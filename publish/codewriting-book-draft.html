<p>There is no sense in postponing my confession: I have written a user manual for the role of technical writer.
The first draft of that sentence originally contained a reference to <em>irony</em>, but in truth it is not at all ironic that technical writers ourselves require instruction.
I’ve strung together a lot of prose in my lifetime, but I’m casting this book project in a format I hope technical writers and software developers will appreciate:
lots of bulleted section headings, lists, sidebars, examples, code listings, and summaries.</p>
</div>

<p>But I&#8217;m also bestowing this book with some rants, because I have things to express.

<p>My first shout out has to go to Eric Sammer, CTO at Rocana, who had the foresight to set me up with such a great documentation toolchain.
Eric has given me room to experiment with the docs at Rocana, just as he and the Engineering organization have kept a constant flow of new challenges streaming across my desk.
I did not take this job with any semblance of a notion that I was stumbling into a nascent (niché) field that so fully fuses writing and development.
Since those are the only two consistent interests on my resumé, I suspect Eric saw more than I evidently did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also want to express appreciation for my manager, Arthur Foelsche.
When your company is so small you&#8217;re the only tech writer, it helps a lot to have somebody who&#8217;s well paid to feign an interest in what you do all day.
Truthfully: through countless hours of coding and conversation, Arthur has pushed and helped me to solve more than a few of the problems I&#8217;m truly excellent at raising.
He also encouraged me to do this book and pursue the initiatives and projects that inspired it, as did everyone in Rocana&#8217;s Engineering department.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Codewriting</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project is my attempt to bridge a gap I straddle between two worlds of writing: the world of words and the world of code.
I have spent my career (over two decades) in and out of media and software, almost always mixing the two in some way, even when mixing them has not been my primary role.
Whether organizing and coding a 4-year experiment in online journalism or developing websites for writers and media operations, I have been dealing with text and code nearly my entire adult life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today, as Technical Documentation Manager at a little “Big Data” IT ops tooling startup called Rocana, gracefully combining technology work with media production remains my biggest challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In technical writing, we have to learn complicated products with a level of intimacy even some engineers find perverse.
We also have to maintain more and more matter from an ever-increasing array of sources, operating as both scribe and librarian in service of highly demanding engineering, product, and support teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then there are the end users.
Here technical writers sometimes feel quite apart from developers.
We aren&#8217;t the ones who deliver the part of the product users love; we make the part they resort to in frustration.
Good docs strive to surprise users, if simply by being good docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_who_is_codewriting_for">Who is Codewriting For?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Several audience roles are front of mind for <em>Codewriting</em>, but I hope thematic lessons will somehow reach beyond people who regularly consider themselves technical communicators.
So much knowledge is poorly organized, and true collaborative, open-source writing remains unpopular despite its astounding advantages.
I blame accessibility, and I believe we&#8217;re on the verge of a revolution in the accessibility of this approach to documentation. I further think that revolution will extend to other forms of documentation: legal, legislative, medical, culinary, pedagogical, and beyond…).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Young people are technical enough to more-intuitively make the conceptual leaps necessary, and before long distributed source control will be a basic technical skill.
While only the “geeks” among Millennials and GenXers readily grasp concepts such as markup and source control systems, these technologies will likely prove trivial to the next generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Likewise, young people are showing greater interest in collaboration.
The efficiencies of highly manageable docs libraries will be popular among the entrepreneurs and community organizers of the world alike.
Which is all to say, this book is for people who want to think about the future of documentation as it evolves.
That&#8217;s thinking big, in ways I&#8217;ll follow up on much later in <a href="#chapter-evolving-beyond">Beyond Technical Communications</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, my focus is on several roles typically found within formal software engineering teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Technical Writers</dt>
<dd>
<p>Obviously, I hope lots of current or aspiring technical writers will make use of this book.
But it is definitely not limited to people who already know about or work in a docs-as-code format.
I have in mind people using DITA and other conventional documentation tools.
And while some background playing with code is very helpful to get started, this book should not require more than basic familiarity with how software is made.</p>

<p>In software, SMEs are mainly developers/engineers.
In any case, these are people who primarily write product source code but are also integral to documenting that code.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SMEs may also include product managers, customer support engineers, and anyone else with product knowledge who might be expected to contribute to user-facing documentation in the course of their work.</p>

<p>These are hackers who integrate IT/automation/infrastructure work, often including QA and testing, with the day-to-day operations of developers.
While perhaps not usually making major direct contributions to docs, DevOps pros can be documentation&#8217;s best friends.
The broad field gives insufficient attention to docs, in my observation, but having the right DevOps specialist devoting a few cycles to docs tooling and testing can make all the difference.
So I hope more DevOps people will take note of new ways to integrate docs with source code, testing, building, and packaging.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DocOps Specialists</dt>
<dd>
<p>This refers to hackers committed to building and using better docs-as-code systems, meaning workflow and process as much as tooling.
I don&#8217;t know that this field exists yet, but I want to make it.
There are lots of people who fit the label, as I see it, but we don&#8217;t have an identity or space of our own.
I think a lot of us are even more socially awkward than coders&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;don&#8217;t think for a moment I&#8217;m not hoping this book earns me some cool-cred from legit programmers.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already doing DocOps, I hope you will find some sense of community and camaraderie in these pages.
If you are not yet doing DocOps but have an interest in hacking platforms <em>and</em> collaboratively writing great docs, maybe this book will provide a coherent framework for approaching this new field.
Even if you&#8217;re unsure about <em>collaboration</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;maybe you are working alone or are unconvinced your SMEs will contribute directly&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;hopefully this book will help you think about and organize your docs.</p>

<div class="title">What&#8217;s in a Label?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps dangerously, I use some software-industry terms in ways that might get me in trouble if I&#8217;m not careful, and I need to review this manuscript for stylistic consistency.
For the most part, here is the breakdown of who&#8217;s who among coders in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I generally use the terms <em>coders</em>, <em>engineers</em>, <em>developers</em>, and <em>programmers</em> all to mean people who write software source code for fun or profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I&#8217;m speaking in relation to a project, I use <em>engineer</em> to mean someone on the core product team and <em>developer</em> to mean someone who may extend the product.
So my immediate coworkers are “engineers”, and third-party developers offering to modularize our product are “developers”.
This term includes no bias as to the skill set of either role, just their relationship to a product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I say <em>hacker</em>, I typically mean someone of pretty much any skill level whose main purpose is pulling together just enough code to get something done.
I include myself in this category, and I wear the label humbly as I scavenge the corners of the Web for tools shared by my betters, hopefully learning to contribute back more, as I develop the nerve to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this book, just for the fun of it, I frequently call DocOps specialists <em>codewriters</em>, as we use code to build docs platforms, and we also write <em>in</em> code <em>about</em> code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, I&#8217;m adopting the word <em>documentarians</em> for anyone directly contributing to documentation, from any role.
You&#8217;re a documentarian if you are into making better docs, i.e., you&#8217;re reading this book.</p>

<h3 id="_objectives_of_codewriting">Objectives of Codewriting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After reading this book and engaging its exercises, you should be better able to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>describe software</strong> to users and <strong>instruct</strong> them in its use;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>support engineers</strong> in more directly communicating their product to its users;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>establish systems</strong> for collaborative documentation using the latest open source tools and platforms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>integrate documentation</strong> into product development and testing… and into the product itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>coordinate contributions</strong> from devs and other SMEs in ways that complement rather than interfere with their <strong>preferred workflows</strong>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>resolve complicated documentation challenges</strong> with an open (if often hackey) approach;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>convert legacy material</strong> to a future-compatible system; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>‘codify’ your technical writing</strong> by thinking like a developer while sharing the product codebase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if some of these lessons do not apply in your current setting, perhaps they will inspire some creative thinking, as they have for me.
There is a lot more to this approach than I will be able to capture in this book, which is part of why you&#8217;re invited to capture it here with me.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_docs_neglected_and_maligned_no_more">Docs: Neglected and Maligned No More?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plenty of organizations have shelled out for big-money subscription products that a whole lot of writers love, and I do not intend to knock these tools, even as I will critique what I see as their limitations.
I&#8217;m more focused on portability, extensibility, and open standards.
I&#8217;ll touch on this more in a moment (<a href="#open-source-centricity">Open Source Centricity</a>), but I find most of the advanced technical documentation tools are lacking in some or all of these areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My preferred tools are lacking in several areas as well, and that&#8217;s another theme of this book, because we really do have power over this tooling.
We don&#8217;t need to wait for companies that hide their source code to grant us sparse updates.
We have so many alternatives, and they&#8217;re maturing quickly at this particular moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conventional software operations, it&#8217;s usually the same scenario; the product gets all the technical focus, and documentation is too often considered separate from the product.
If you&#8217;re a technical writer, you may not even be considered a contributor to the product; your work is merely passed along <em>with</em> the product.
It&#8217;s highly likely that your output does not come near the product it describes until packaging&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if even then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The onset of the <em>Dev</em>Ops mindset/movement has mainly helped docs indirectly, as many of their integration tools have docs applications, even if only as a side effect or afterthought.
It&#8217;s high time we take advantage of all of this tooling.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above diagram makes no mention of documentation, and I&#8217;m not complaining.
This is an accurate reflection of the DevOps focus, and docs are not an integral part of that cycle.
Where they are, they may be considered part of the <em>code</em> that this toolchain/process is acting on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation needs to be integrated with this process, or it will always be an afterthought, but that&#8217;s not a DevOps job alone.
If technical writers and documentation managers aren&#8217;t going to step up and use advanced tools to integrate their work with that of engineers, how is DevOps supposed to see docs as an integrated element?
Right now, in plenty of shops, bright-eyed DevOps ninjas are pretending not to see the old-timey trainwreck that has become of the company&#8217;s legacy documentation setup.
They&#8217;re not failing us; they&#8217;re understandably averting their eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Docs are as essential to product development and delivery as these other elements, or so we keep telling ourselves, product managers keep swearing by, and CTOs and engineers pay lip service to, sometimes.
They&#8217;re just often not as well integrated, which leads to them not being as current, complete, and accurate.
Which gives product and engineering leadership actual reason to deemphasize documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentarians can expect the tooling and attention we believe our contributions and field deserve only if we&#8217;re willing to engage with it the way our SMEs do.
It&#8217;s time to get hacking.</p>

<p>The good news is documentation <em>can</em> be performed using the latest/greatest methods and technologies for collaborative writing, content management, version control, product delivery, and much more.
What differentiates <em>Codewriting</em> from other technical writing and communications books is that it is solidly rooted in building cohesion and collaboration among product development (Engineering), testing and delivery (DevOps, QA), and product documentation (Docs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This advice intends to build mutual respect among the different roles for each other&#8217;s work, across the members of the product development team.
For tech writers, it&#8217;s all about drawing lessons from our colleagues who write more code than words.
As repayment for letting us tag along on their awesomesauce, we promise to provide them with consistently improving documentation experiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I see the wisdom of developers and project managers from lean/agile backgrounds infused into this new approach.
Tech writers and docs managers in forward-thinking environments have been building this trend for a while.
It&#8217;s an exciting time to be gleaning insights and strategies from leaders in a nascent field&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I intend to include many of their voices in this work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My point is not that conventional tech writing techniques yield poor results.
Lots of talented technical writers and documentation managers do excellent work with what I consider inferior strategies and tooling.
The new methodology I expound upon in this book has meanwhile produced only a small minority of the truly remarkable technical documentation projects of our time, and it has just barely been validated at scale.</p>

I wish to note that while I talk up the DocOps/docs-as-code approach, I am by no means its author, and I&#8217;m definitely not its most skilled practitioner.
So I&#8217;m not bragging when I argue strenuously that this strategy is “superior”.
This whole book is an attempt at documenting a set of ideas I stumbled into and feel remarkably privileged to have access to, <em>even though they&#8217;re all totally free</em> (as in no credit card necessary and as in open source).

<p>My argument is simply that this approach and these tools are better for collaborative software documentation (especially for agile or agile-oriented dev teams) than the conventional industry standards and stalwarts.
All else being equal, a well-established docs-as-code/DocOps system should produce “better” content&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more accurate, more current, more appropriate, etc&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;than the conventional methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just a hypothesis, far from proven.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If none of the above bullet points rings true, or if your current work situation will not accommodate the growth necessary to head in exciting new directions, perhaps this book may still contain valuable insights.
It&#8217;s main goal remains integrating readers' <em>understanding</em> of the development process and environment.
And <em>Codewriting</em> definitely won&#8217;t stop trying to help you to rethink technical documentation holistically.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_docs_as_code">Docs as Code</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My mantra, <em>everything in code</em>, has a dual meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>First, all technical writing should be sourced in markup and compiled to rich output</strong> like HTML and PDF, or specialized output such as Unix "man" pages, user interface elements, specialized app content, or even presentation slide decks.
This is a pretty broadly accepted technical documentation principle, especially considering pretty much <em>any</em> tool you can think of saves its files in markup, whether the user ever sees that markup or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Codewriting</em> further favors writing <em>directly</em> in markup, as opposed to using a visualization tool that&#8217;s generating XML in the background, such as Word and Google Docs.
Tech-writing tools like oXygen, Adobe Framemaker, and Madcap Flare, which use DITA, Docbook, and other XML-based markups, attempt to provide a rich-text interface to the user, mercifully suppressing the verbose, hyper-nested tags establishing the document structure.
The case for this is developed in the second chapter, <a href="#chapter-writing-code">Writing {preposition} Code</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Second, “everything in code” means put the docs in the product codebase</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not in a database, not in a separate repo.
This excludes most conventional wiki and web-based CMS platforms, as they depend on relational databases that hide the source behind a tool that is wholly inadequate for source and version control.
We&#8217;ll discuss integrating your documentation source and platform into the repo and the product itself.
This is addressed in <a href="#chapter-coding-integration">Docs-Code Integration</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll detail this much further in a little while, but briefly: in the above diagram we see developers writing code <em>and</em> docs in the same repo (or docs in a “subrepo”).
The build and deploy platform compiles source code into product code, and it can do this with writing and graphics in HTML, PDF, or other output, as it can with any part of the product&#8217;s user interface.
Output is output&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it can be packaged with the product or posted online, all with just a few commands during the release process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons I love the docs-as-code approach, but the key advantages are the flexibility it allows on both ends: input and output.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Lots of people in different roles can readily contribute to documentation efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content is managed as discrete components of a whole, instead of merely at the document level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All content can be single-sourced, meaning tech writers and engineers maintain one canonical source of truth, no matter how many places that content needs to appear in the generated docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the obvious PDF and HTML formats, content can be published as e-book formats, JSON objects, Unix man pages, even slide decks for presentations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whatever the situation calls for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditions such as environment (where will it appear) and audience (end-users vs developers, for example) can determine what content is compiled in a given “edition”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">How is any of this new?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps all this talk of flexibility leaves you scratching your head, since much of this is what every component content management system (CCMS) promises.
So what&#8217;s the big deal?
Yes, the platform solutions I will describe in this book are technically CCMSes.
But there is a big difference between the proprietary, corporatized packaged CCMS solutions on the market today and those being built from scratch by innovative codewriters, including people far more clever than I am.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might think the biggest obstacle is budget.
One of the common groans about commercial CCMSes is that they are pricey, so it would stand to reason that more low-budget or early-stage organizations would be turning to a DocOps approach.
But some of the pioneers of this new wave of software documentation are at places like CA, Cisco, PayPal, Amazon, Rackspace, and Microsoft.
Surely they could afford the highest priced consultants and enterprise solutions, yet prominent teams at these companies opted to hack their own toolchains using open-source ingredients.</p>

<p>I love open source.
I love it in principle, and I love it in practice.
Free open source software (FOSS) gives us collaborative power commercial software will never permit.
My bias on this matter will be on display throughout, so I thought I&#8217;d take a second to <em>prefend</em> it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow me to briefly overwhelm you with reasons we should all use as much open-source software as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Open source means access.</dt>
<dd>
<p>When we use and support open-source tools, we increase access to them for people with less means.
Some of the biggest, greediest companies have realized the value of giving back through open source.
More access means more contributors means more engagement.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Open source means power.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Inequitable distribution of power and inflexible hierarchies and workflows are hugely restricting factors in product development.
Fast-paced engineering teams have no room for environmentally imposed constraints on what they can get done.
Like DevOps, DocOps must make product developers (including documentarians) more productive, part of which is done by tweaking existing tools to accommodate agile content development needs.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Open source means transparency.</dt>
<dd>
<p>By definition, open source gives more people a view into our work.
Transparency is good for accountability.
Even if the audience that is getting a window into your work is relatively private (for instance, your engineering team), the point is to keep your technical writing copy in a repo others have access to.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Open source transparency means security and accuracy.</dt>
<dd>
<p>I think the ancient myth that exposing your source code makes you more vulnerable <em>per se</em> has been successfully debunked by now.
But consider the implications of public audits of your docs, accompanied by greater capacity to incorporate users' contributions to complement or patch our work.
If this sounds threatening at first, that&#8217;s okay; open source collaboration has the natural effect of making you appreciate rather than fear <em>learning and taking effective action on</em> the inaccuracies our users are already seeing.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Discerning engineers prefer open source.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The most directly valuable reason you should favor and engage with open source solutions is that most of the best engineers are open source enthusiasts, if not devotees.
Not only does this suggest there is something to the phenomenon, but it means you&#8217;ll need to appreciate and get comfortable with open source if you want to earn the respect of the most discerning engineers you may work with.
Using FOSS won&#8217;t make you cool, but over-dependence on proprietary, closed-source tools will cost you respect.</p>

<h3 id="_two_words_distributed_platforms">Two Words: Distributed. Platforms.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These words aren&#8217;t just my two favorite buzzwords, over which I&#8217;ll spend much of this book poking fun at myself and the industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Distributed platforms mean <em>delegated contributing power</em>, which is key to comprehensive documentation, especially in growing, agile environments.
If you want to be successful producing documentation for ever-changing, ever-expanding software products, the only thing I know for sure is you will need a platform solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, platforms are extensible.
Any dynamic engineering team is constantly extending its tools.
All those Slack, GitHub, and JIRA extensions, all that work in Docker, Chef, Jenkins, Gradle, and on down the list.
That is platform configuration, integration, and extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s Engineering pulling tools together to establish a badass development, testing, packaging, and delivery system.
It doesn&#8217;t work perfectly.
There are complaints.
The product keeps rolling out.
It has bugs.
They get patched.
The world keeps turning, and life is a lot better than it could be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentarians need to be in on that cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more complex your team and product, the more extensibility you are going to need.
This means your platform will not come complete in a box, though there are promising SaaS (software as a service) solutions on the market already that meet many of the conditions I advocate in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book will help you work through the various options, including hybrid platforms that will scratch various itches coherently with a bit of iterative hacking performed along the way.
In fact, we&#8217;ll explore numerous tooling options as we plan and begin to build a platform solution as exercises in this book.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lean_docs_for_lean_projects">Lean Docs for Lean Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One last note before getting on with the book and exploring some topics in real depth:
Documentation can be as lean and agile as any product code, even if it inherently lags behind in real time.
The truth is, unless you are somehow afforded miraculous amounts of time to document your product and docs are part of your team&#8217;s “definition of done” for a feature, it is likely that you will need to iterate from a “minimum viable product” for your user manual, help site, or other documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully with whatever product docs you&#8217;re working on, you and the rest of the product team can triage the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>the essentials your docs need for their first version release;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what content needs updating every single release cycle;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what new types of content can be added during each cycle; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any stretch goals that might enhance the docs in some way if we can get to it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started my job at Rocana over two years ago.
At first, I began adding chapters to the <em>Rocana Ops Reference Guide</em>, which I believe had three chapters when I found it.
Then I went back and fleshed some of the older chapters out, or revisited old content and freshened it up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now I use that extra time to build systems so maintaining and freshening my docs will be more streamlined and systematic.
DocOps has become a priority so that when we hit our next growth spurt, the documentation system will be able to accommodate more engineers, more product features, and more customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a fantasy, I someday get to split the ol' RefGuide into several editions, all drawing from the same source codebase:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>an <em>Analyst&#8217;s Guide</em> for end users who monitor data with our product;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an <em>Administrator&#8217;s Guide</em> to help configure and maintain the product;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <em>Developer&#8217;s Guide</em> for our own team as well as third-party devs looking to extend our platform; and finally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a <em>Field Guide</em>, which is a special edition for our engineers, including our testing and automation as well as customer success and sales engineers, where they can maintain version-controlled notes, scripts, snippets, workarounds&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a knowledge base cohabitating with the product in one happy source repo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My background in lean startups and agile development operations has given me insight into the applications of these mindsets to docs, and even with just what I can envision, the possibilities are very exciting.
I want to share them with you, because there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to pursue them all myself, and life is too short for proprietary knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, I suspect much of what seems like limitations of this approach may just be the boundaries of my mind and brief experience.
I hope readers will prove me right about docs-as-code by showing just how little of the picture I foresee, even in my optimism.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am researching and writing this book so I can get better at what I do.
I currently have no tech writer peers at work.
This lack of direct peers has had the added benefit of forcing me to have esoteric conversations with engineers and my manager (also a developer), but I do from time to time want to talk about documentation with colleagues who live and breathe docs.
My current team appreciates docs more than the average engineer, but not the way you probably do, dear reader.</p>
</div>

<p>I believe the exercise of writing this book will improve my skills in all of the above-listed objectives, which I may or may not already do well enough to instruct on.

<h3 id="_what_docs_are">What Docs Are</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you&#8217;ll see, I have a liberal view of what constitutes “technical documentation” at a software company&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;probably more in tune with what many call “technical communications”.
I also have a broad definition of what falls under the purview of technical documentation management.
I prefer to be within one hop of every significant technology document the Engineering organization touches, from knowledge base articles to slide decks to drafts of blog posts and white papers.
This does not mean I want to be in charge of it all; I certainly don&#8217;t want to review it, let alone edit it.
I just like to know what is where, or at least how to find everything.
And it means I want the engineers I work with to know I care about all that stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I work regularly with developers and project managers in Engineering, as well as everybody in Customer Success.
Having <em>their</em> docs in order makes my life better in numerous ways which we&#8217;ll explore throughout this book.
For now, I want to introduce the theme that bad documentation is everybody&#8217;s problem, not just users’.
And documentation itself is way more than just the docs you prepare for end users or third-party developers, or even anything you might need to produce for Marketing.
It&#8217;s all of the meeting notes, specs, task-management issues, Git commit messages, help desk tickets, and on and on.
Well kept, these are also your assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is going to dwell plenty on what tech docs <em>are</em>, but first let&#8217;s clear up what docs <em>aren&#8217;t</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_docs_are_not_for_reading">Docs Are Not for Reading</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I try not to refer to <em>reading</em> docs, but rather <em>using</em> them.
That is because I believe, quite simply, that <em>good technical writing is not even meant to be read</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, if you consider books like this one to be <em>technical writing</em>, then <em>some</em> technical writing is meant to be read like prose&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;although I do not expect it to be read cover-to-cover or even in order.
Still, most product-related technical documentation will <em>not be</em> read, no matter how it was intended by its authors.
And if your work will not be read conventionally, it makes little sense to write it as if it will be read conventionally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re a technical writer more than you are a developer (and no, engineers, it doesn&#8217;t count that you <em>feel like</em> you spend more time writing docs than code), you probably love to write as much as any novelist, journalist, or poet.
If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re working on a novel or three, and maybe you&#8217;ll get the nerve to submit that cookbook to an agent someday soon.
But the only thing that&#8217;s getting <em>published</em> at the moment is that damn user manual, so you&#8217;d better believe we&#8217;re going to <em>write</em> that thing as if someone is <em>reading</em> it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually there is even a spot here or there, in the introduction or a sidebar, where we can open up that throttle and write a few contiguous paragraphs of prose, really let the wind of the open page have its way with our free-flowing hair.
We cherish the relative latitude and runway of these interludes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But mostly we don&#8217;t write; instead:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We <em>keep track of</em> content that fits better in tables, charts, and lists than in paragraphs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <em>follow our own instructions</em>, hoping to catch docs bugs before customers or developers do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <em>chase down developers</em>, explaining that cave etchings are preferred to nothing, but secretly wondering why people who can code in seven programming languages can&#8217;t be bothered to write a formatted list in English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <em>pester our users and coworkers</em> about the docs, whether they use them, "Why not?", "Could you maybe just give them a try?", and of course the old, "Yes, they were included with the installation and are on our website".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We <em>prune, reformat, and edit</em> scribbles, notes, and sometimes well-written content from SMEs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we <em>create visualizations</em> we hope make sense to people who actually use this stuff (be that an end user or a designer who will upgrade our graphics).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you look at a given page of a user manual or a section of a README, there might seem to be about as much of the <em>writer</em> in <em>product documentation</em> as there is the <em>jockey</em> in a <em>horse race</em>.
It absolutely matters who is on the horse, but everybody knows the best horse will win as long as the jockey is competent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But this analogy falls apart when you consider the variety of modern software products, and just how easy it is for today&#8217;s software to depart from convention and require unorthodox documentation.
If you are fortunate enough to document a product that is trying to reinvent its space, there may be no blueprint for how to convey that product to users.
They may be more dependent on your contextualization and conceptualization of the product than they typically need to be when they encounter a “new” solution, since most product interfaces are essentially ripoffs of the most successful player in the space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just because we do not always get to spout off freely as I am right now does not mean decisions made by technical writers are not critical to the success of a product.
Docs may not close deals very often, but bad docs can frustrate, costing degrees of a potential customer&#8217;s confidence.</p>

<h3 id="_reading_docs">Reading Docs</h3>

<p>All of that said, I do think one can appreciate good docs at face value.
Sometimes when I&#8217;m looking for a way to solve a problem, I run into some incidental aspect of another product&#8217;s documentation, which I can appreciate only in the abstract.
Even at a glance, I recognize excellence in presentation, and the hair stands on the back of my neck.
We lucky kinksters who appreciate good docs on an aesthetic level have a distinct advantage.</p>

Your new coworkers are probably referring to poor documentation of a product they actually admire, if not a product they regularly use and may even adore on some level.
Learn what frustrates your coworkers about those docs, then try actually using the docs with that third-party product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll talk a lot about getting to know how developers operate.
Earn the respect of coders you work with by walking in their shoes.
If several engineers on your team are frustrated because they&#8217;ve been told to work with a dependency library they don&#8217;t love, there&#8217;s a very good chance the library is poorly documented.
Go investigate and maybe play with that dependency.
Even if it&#8217;s above your skill level and you fail, the process will yield benefits, empathy not least among them.
You will have a better understanding of what developers are talking and complaining about, and you&#8217;ll have a functional analysis of what is frustrating about docs your coworkers use every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can repeat this process with users, whether they be third-party developers or end consumers, you&#8217;ll glean even more insights.</p>

If you have a separate wiki or guide set up for each role, pass everybody along to the right landing page for their docs needs.

<blockquote>
One of the more common attributes of “docs-as-code” is writing docs directly in markup.
This brings documentation a step closer to product code, even if you&#8217;re not yet keeping the docs in flat files inside the product source repository.
Just as importantly for many, it liberates the writing process from proprietary tooling and overwrought interfaces.

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_s_with_that_chapter_title">What&#8217;s with that Chapter Title?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure whether I wanted to title this chapter “Writing <em>in</em> Code” or “Writing Code”, and I thought there was some chance I might make it “Writing in Code, about Code” or some other permutation.
The uncertainty is perfect for introducing one of the most crucial technical elements of codewriting: dynamism.
Allow me to demonstrate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I wanted to be able to publish different editions of this book in which this chapter title were variously named, I could insert a variable between “Writing” and “Code”.
That variable is a token that could be replaced by a value determined at the time of publishing, set to either a blank value or <code>in</code> or <code>in Code, about</code>.
These would yield their respective prepositional representation depending on which audience the edition was for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Writing Code”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Writing in Code”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Writing in Code, about Code”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, that anecdote is totally fabricated, and it&#8217;s not even the most realistic example, but it provides opportunity to start making a case I&#8217;ll develop throughout this chapter.
My point isn&#8217;t that your text has to be peppered with dynamic elements but that your documentation as a whole should be flexible and adaptive.
First thing&#8217;s first, however; let&#8217;s take a look at that text and code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dynamic_writing">Dynamic Writing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ll explore more when we look at how best to serve users’ needs, the ability to serve just the right content to just the right audience in just the right place can provide great advantages.
This is especially true for mature products with multiple tiers or roles of users, such as enterprise platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What I&#8217;ve typed to make the chapter title above is the following string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">= Writing \{preposition} Code</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is dynamic lightweight markup, intended to be “parsed” and output in various rich-text formats.
My dynamic lightweight markup language (DLML) of choice is called AsciiDoc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In AsciiDoc, the <code>=</code> indicates I want the text that follows to represent a top-level heading (title), but let&#8217;s set that aside for now.
The real curiosity is <code>{preposition}</code>.
In AsciiDoc, I can indicate a placeholder for content by wrapping the the key in <code>{ }</code> characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>\</code> here is because in this title, I want to show you the <em>actual tag</em>, instead of parsing it with the value of a key named <code>preposition</code>.
In programming, this is known as <em>escaping</em> code&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;using markers to indicate that you <em>do not</em> want a portion of code to be processed normally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I can declare and then reference what AsciiDoc calls an <em>attribute</em> (known generally as a <em>variable</em> in programming as in elementary mathematics):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">:preposition: in
= Writing {preposition} Code</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see what happened there, but maybe you don&#8217;t see the advantage.
Why not just write the word <code>in</code> instead of <code>{preposition}</code> where I want the text substituted?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if I were to have set up a “switch” of sorts, in order to set the value of <code>preposition</code> variably, depending on some extra input?
For instance:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">ifeval::[{audience} == "developers"]
// assign blank value
:preposition:
endif::[]
ifeval::[{audience} == "techwriters"]
:preposition: in
endif::[]
ifeval::[{audience} == "mom"]
:preposition: in Code, about
endif::[]

= Writing {preposition} Code</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, we have to pass into this bit of code a variable named <code>audience</code>, which we can do when it comes time to build our document, depending which edition we&#8217;re generating at the time.
Once we&#8217;ve set <code>audience</code>, its value will determine whether <code>{preposition}</code> resolves to <code>in</code>, <code>in Code, about</code>, or remains blank.
To solve our problem of having three different editions depending on who will read it, we just generate a customized doc for each audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This isn&#8217;t likely to be an entirely new concept to any tech writer, let alone any developer.
My real interest is to start showing off the dynamism made possible by DLMLs.
Tag-based languages like DITA may provide a degree of dynamism, but for reasons we&#8217;ll explore more later, they tend to limit collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-dynamic lightweight markup languages are the other contrast.
Markdown is the most popular lightweight markup language, and it is highly conducive to collaboration, but it does not provide for dynamism or semantic contextualization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For tech writers, my promise is that there are amazing tools that will give you not just more technical power, but more buy-in from Product and Engineering.
With tooling integration and SME collaboration, stakeholders will see that small investments in documentation can pay off in big ways.
We&#8217;re out to make the case that smart investments in DocOps can yield a bigger return than shiny solutions with big price tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For engineers, I&#8217;m promising you there are better ways to write great docs that center around users' needs, and you don&#8217;t have to learn obscure, proprietary tools to take advantage.
The truth is, engineering teams have been documenting products in code since long before this trend hit the technical communications world.
Now, whether you have dedicated technical writers or you&#8217;re expected to write and maintain the docs yourselves, engineering teams can document the product as well as they can document the code base or an API.
And they can use tools that combine the best of the engineer&#8217;s world (flat files, distributed source control, and build tooling with continuous integration) with the style, semanticism, and output flexibility of advanced tech-writing solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_lightweight_markup">Lightweight Markup</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I feel strongly that I cannot go wrong encouraging people to try AsciiDoc.
The response I&#8217;ve received from engineers so far has been overwhelmingly positive, and after more than two years of constant use, I still find examples of elegance and forethought in AsciiDoc all the time.
As I explore its extensibility, I&#8217;m fairly confident I can solve nearly all of the hardest DocOps challenges I face with AsciiDoc-centric toolchains and frameworks.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That said, I highly respect reStructuredText (RST) and believe it is likely just a matter of one&#8217;s taste in markup style and the platform for extensibility (Python for RST, Ruby or Python for AsciiDoc).
I have not had the opportunity to use RST in production, and I&#8217;m just writing what I know.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll also look at DITA, the leading dynamic markup language for technical documentation.
While not a lightweight language, DITA-based platforms offer some advantages we will explore.
I will admittedly spend most of that effort deriving lessons from the highly capable and experienced DITA community in order to apply them to DLML-oriented solutions accessible to the rest of us.</p>

<p>AsciiDoc and reStructuredText differ from Markdown in several key ways.
At a minimum, what makes them “dynamic” are the following characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">variables</dt>

<p>A DLML lets you set a key/value pair that can be represented by tokens throughout the document, which will be substituted with their value when processed.</p>

<dd>
<p>There must be at least one actively supported standard or platform for extending the DLML by adding dynamic and semantic capabilities.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A great DLML has many more features, as we will discuss later, and there are attempts underway to extend Markdown to incorporate at least some of these capabilities.
A little extra tooling can enhance a Markdown-sourced docs system to accommodate dynamic features.
For now, AsciiDoc and RST are a ways ahead.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, I do not argue that the nascent docs-as-code movement should reject tag-based markup or non-dynamic lightweight markup in the documentation source.
I can certainly think of legitimate documentation cases where variables, includes, and conditionals are simply not called for.
I also know there are teams that love DITA and make widespread use of it and its tools, collaboratively and in close connection to the product, even using Git-based solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source code is source code, as we&#8217;ll explore much further in <a href="#chapter-coding-source">Source Coding</a>.

<h3 id="_semantic_structure">Semantic Structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I first learned to “write” HTML in 1996, I did not actually write very much HTML.
The WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor had already emerged, and it got all those <code>&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a href="some-long-url"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags out of the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This meant I rarely had to see the code I was writing in.
I only looked under the hood to fix an editor-generated bug or to write some HTML the editor could not yet do for me with a few menu commands.
When it came to writing, I worked in a tool that was essentially as elegant and practical for <em>writing</em> in HTML as the best WYSIWYG editors of today.
The editor abstracted the HTML, showing me something more akin to what the world would see upon publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I learned to write functional software (not just static web pages), I started to appreciate seeing all that markup, as well as all the scripts and database calls that were making my page content powerfully dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dynamism is no small thing in digital content, but nothing is more fundamental to tech docs than <em>semantic structure</em>.
Your content has to have structure that conveys <em>purpose and utility, not just placement and style</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every chunk of quotation, every admonition, every diagram, every code listing, and every instruction step&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all your content has potential relevance to its digital context.
More than mere clusters of characters or bytes, the assortment of files that make up your docs can have various relationships with a range of documents and media, from a print manual to the product interface to video to a presentation slide deck about the product.
So it matters what you put behind your words and pictures in order to indicate <em>if</em> and <em>how</em> they should be conveyed to the audience.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve never written and executed your own code, it might be difficult to appreciate the power of programmatic writing.
We&#8217;re going to overcome that during the course of this book as you see the power of treating your documentation as an application.
It&#8217;s true that traditional content management systems (CMSes) offer remarkable publishing capabilities.
But they also sell you short on control over your docs at the source level.</p>
</div>

<p>Only languages and toolchains that offer you inline dynamism&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and here I mean DITA as much as AsciiDoc or RST&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;actually enhance the power of your writing.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll pretty much never see a serious software engineer writing source code using tools that hide the code of the programming language they&#8217;re coding in.
There are exceptions to this for complex code, such as formulas and algorithms, which are perhaps better generated automatically than having typed every character written by hand.
And some coders like to collapse portions of their code from view when they&#8217;re not touching or referencing it, which feature modern code editors typically offer out of the box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But for the most part, developers strive to achieve a sort of Pareto efficiency with relation to their source code, to use an economistic notion.
That is, good coders get as close to the source code as they can without adding undue burden.
Their toolbox is such that any change would decrease the overall effectiveness of their programming.
I have never personally approached this mythic relationship to code, but I have heard it spoken of under certain influences, and I believe I&#8217;ve caught glimpses of it in the wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These exemplary coders use dependency libraries carefully, but not because they&#8217;re afraid to code the perfect solution themselves.
They recognize the trade off each time they choose to fork a project or set out anew.
Going with the current of the open source crowd has significant benefits; nobody is saying you need to be a pioneer to take advantage of the open source universe.</p>

I don&#8217;t see the clusters of <code>1</code>|<code>0</code> combos behind this text, but I do see the markup notations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in fact, I type them explicitly.
Our editor can help us cheat a little, with distinctive formatting inline and a WYSIWIGish view in an adjacent panel.</p>

<h3 id="_docs_in_flat_files">Docs in Flat Files</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing you won&#8217;t find developers doing is keeping all their source code in a relational database.
Typical packaged systems for content management (CMS, e.g., Wordpress, Drupal), contact relationship management (CRM, e.g., Salesforce), project management (PM, e.g., JIRA, Basecamp), and wikis (e.g., WikiMedia) all use RDB backends.
This is for good reason, as the tools require levels of abstraction that eliminate most user choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most such tools, abstraction and limited capability go hand in hand.
In fact, all these management systems typically offer popular cloud-based options precisely because customers have realized that conformity is an acceptable price to pay for platform supportability and stability.
Platforms remove headaches.
For many choices facing a technical organization, going with a platform can be the best call.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_flat_file_anarchy">Flat-file Anarchy</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coders are less likely to see it that way.
Coding UIs are of course far more anarchic than PMs or CMSes, and not because engineers just want to be cowboys (even the ones who do).
They reject systems of constraint that come in the form of form-field validations that reject improperly formatted entries; coders write their own integration tests, thank you very much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For coders, the flat file is the Wild West.
It&#8217;s Ctrl+Shift+N, followed by typing a file extension that reveals the source language (<code>flat-file.java</code>, <code>flat-file.py</code>, <code>flat-file.rb</code>, <code>flat-file.js</code>, <code>flat-file.json</code> etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see the commonality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flat file offers not just a fresh slate, it enables source control.
Many advanced CMSes offer version control, which can trace drafts and compare differences across iterations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source control offers all of this with the added power of <em>forking</em>.
That is, independent copies can live in separate code repositories, changing and potentially reintegrating down the road.
The power of this for documentation may not be immediately obvious, but as we go on, we&#8217;ll see it illustrated in a few key ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The point is, coders love the open-ended potential of the flat file.
But coders aren&#8217;t berzerkers.</p>

<h4 id="_reign_of_the_review">Reign of the Review</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The virtual space of the development environment is often anything but chaotic.
Great tech leads, project managers, and peers impose on engineers the kind of order you&#8217;d expect from strict editors in journalism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The environment and workflow can have severe constraints in place at points prior to code integration.
A sloppy developer like me may spend weeks thwacking freely at the keyboard before submitting the resulting source code to unit tests, regression tests, and however many rounds of peer assessments may be waiting during code review.
In the end, all code must pass muster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not going to try to sell you on the complete vision just yet&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I merely wish to make the case that flat files can be as simple and manageable as wiki pages, yet they leave the platform open to more flexible construction of document and data structures on the fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the “platform” may be more of a “framework” such as those used by developers to provide logic, convention, and usually a great deal of prepared dependency code.
A development framework is a relatively open playground compared to a CMS, but don&#8217;t let this notion scare you off if you&#8217;re not a developer or hacker (yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the same time, if you&#8217;re a serious coder, I don&#8217;t want to oversell the docs frameworks you&#8217;ll find out there.
I don&#8217;t even know if this approach will prove popular, let alone get the support it needs.
It&#8217;s early days, and we&#8217;ll discuss this more in <a href="#chapter-delivering-hacking">Hacking</a>.</p>

<p>From the end-user&#8217;s perspective, there are only two aspects of documentation that matter: content and delivery.
Even if users could learn all about <em>how</em> you made the docs, they wouldn&#8217;t be interested, and they wouldn&#8217;t appreciate it.

<p>This and other chapters will touch on <em>what</em> goes into good docs, but <em>how</em> we keep our docs in good shape remains the main focus.
In maintaining good docs, no concept is more importance than the ability to establish and maintain the elusive “single source of truth” for all the content you generate, be it in the docs or in the product.</p>

<h3 id="_keeping_docs_dry">Keeping Docs DRY</h3>

<p>Put all the information a user needs right at their fingertips without creating half a dozen sources of truth for every fact.
The developer&#8217;s mantra of "Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself" (DRY) applies every bit as much to technical content source as to product source code.
You may display the same table two different ways in four or fourteen different places, just to be sure it is always at your user&#8217;s fingertips, but keep only one copy of that table or its source data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the technical documentation world, you&#8217;re more likely to hear this concept called <em>single sourcing</em>, which I&#8217;m also down with.</p>

<h3 id="topic-based-authoring">Topic-based Authoring</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the key contributions of the DITA community is the strategic modularization of content in reusable chunks, which aids single sourcing but also helps us think about how we organize and deliver content.
Known as <em>topic-based authoring</em>, this approach favors clean reuse of content source in different contexts by helping us think about content in its simplest useful form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wikipedia does the strategy some justice:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A topic is a discrete piece of content that is about a specific subject, has an identifiable purpose, and can stand alone (does not need to be presented in context for the end-user to make sense of the content). Topics are also reusable. They can, when constructed properly (without reliance on other content for its meaning), be reused in any context anywhere needed.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ll get into some examples momentarily, but I don&#8217;t want to introduce this topic without expressing its greater value to content strategy.
As a side effect, topic-based authoring prompts us to think of content in logical blocks.
I&#8217;m sure every team/style/project will define topic parameters and properties differently, but I must admit I&#8217;ve found this enormously helpful in my own work
Even as it suggests I should make Herculean efforts to overhaul the structure of so much of my work, I know the benefits will be huge.
Formally achieving what I&#8217;ll call topic-based DRYness will give me all the building blocks of a truly modular docs system at Rocana.
Publishing all those various guides and knowledge bases for various user audiences, all from the same canonical source, will then be a matter of just listing topics to appear in each final document.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_topical_thinking">Topical Thinking</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In its simplest form, topic-based authoring has come to mean keeping my content files to the minimum size I could reasonably approve of devoting a web page to.
Right out of the gate, that&#8217;s a subjective judgment, but since I have spent 20 years building websites, I have a pretty concrete idea of what size and scope of information should get a dedicated page on a website, and what scopes should not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a complete series of simple installation instructions deserves a web page; each step in that simple process most likely does not.
A bibliography or glossary deserves its own page on a website; a single citation or term definition does not.
A person&#8217;s complete dating profile deserves its own web page; the summary of their image thumbnail, age, and match rating belong in an index listing, not each to their own page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way of looking at it: if a discrete content item might serve well in a “tooltip” or “popover”-style element on a web page, it probably lacks the makings of a topic.
The page it is on is likely made up of one or more topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The supersets of topics tend to be “documents”, to invoke a dangerously broad class term.
Think of <em>web pages</em>, <em>articles</em>, and <em>chapters</em> as documents, even where they are also children of parent documents (<em>website</em>, <em>periodical</em>, and <em>book</em>, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, a document is suited for topic-based authoring when it:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>must reflect highly technical and exact information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contains various types of content sub-elements, such as</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>code listings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>admonitions</p>

<li>

<li>
<p>includes content that is best single-sourced in order to constrain divergence during reuse and redistribution</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Point <strong>3</strong> here is crucial: we&#8217;re only going to use this method for content that should not be expressed in substantially different ways such that just writing it differently each time makes more sense.
This excludes concepts that should be re-expressed with nuance or fundamental differences in various places, if only to help different users learn something a different way or from a different perspective.</p>

<div class="title">Single-sourcing vs inline expression</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our product Rocana Ops, the most fundamental concept we need our users to truly understand is how we treat a type of data we call an <em>event</em>.
We&#8217;re not the only ones in the industry to call it an event, and not everything that we call an <em>event</em> is actually what you would think of as an event.
For this reason, there are several paragraphs throughout our docs that help users understand what we mean by an <em>event</em> in Rocana Ops.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Introduction chapter and other materials that might be read by somewhat less-technical users, an event is described in a way a Chief Information Officer at an enterprise might need to know it.
This person knows at least generally how IT works and can conceptualize what our product specifically means when we describe this type of data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the chapters go on, more-specific roles of user necessitate different contextual understandings of the event structure and usage, so in each place, I simply write about events in a context-appropriate way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when it comes to the strict AVRO data schema that defines and constrains these data objects we call <em>events</em>, divergence from the exact truth is pretty dangerous.
Ideally, we want to make sure the example event schema shown in the the Reference Guide is drawn from <em>exactly</em> the same file that is used by the product itself.
Engineers can thus make edits to this canonical file that will automatically be reflected in all our docs talking about the event schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the changes are significant, they&#8217;ll probably need to be reflected elsewhere in the docs, perhaps even in some of those various descriptive paragraphs about <em>events</em>.
But at least our literal expression of the event schema will stay consistent, even if I fail to note the changes, I won&#8217;t have to actively copy them from the developers.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concept of choosing <em>not</em> to treat certain discrete items as topics in and of themselves may require its own treatment.
We&#8217;ll start with an example that works in the other direction, where we definitely want to use consistent language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s consider a commonly reused admonition for a dangerous upgrade procedure:</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock warning">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-warning" title="Warning"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Back up your data before performing this step.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is how I defined this chunk of content in my source, which I&#8217;ve just typed into the very same file this current text is typed into:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">[WARNING]
Back up your data before performing this step.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In my view, this block is too small to constitute a topic in and of itself.
I conclude this even though I may reuse that language in 36 places across three versions of a product being maintained, with four to nine places this exact admonition text appears in each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With content like this, it would not even be the end of the world if we decide to update this language some day and have to do a source-wide search-and-replace operation across the docs portion of our codebase.
(In fact, even most database-backed content-management systems enable this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m also not likely to want to create a new source file for each instance of such a simple snippet of content.
You won&#8217;t find this anywhere in my several projects of AsciiDoc files.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example File&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;topics/admonitions/backup_warning.adoc</div>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">[WARNING]
Back up your data before performing this step.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No, you won&#8217;t find files containing such simplistic, limited content, but you will find me craving the convenience of knowing that kind of precise knowledge or language is maintained in and drawn from a canonical source, and that I don&#8217;t have to remember to search-and-replace any change to it.
I find it too burdensome to give each such element its own file, but I want the advantages of single-sourcing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the elegance of being able to simply edit a single source for this discrete chunk of text.
In this example, it has been brought to our attention that our users think backing their data up to their own account on the server suffices for this step, but we really want them to <em>download</em> a backup.
We&#8217;ll explain this elsewhere, but when we drop the warning in various places in our docs, we want them to be reminded that we mean saving the backup to their local machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example File&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;topics/admonitions.adoc</div>

<p>This section is not called “<em>master</em> the product” for good reason: mastery is rarely the point.
Master users are abnormal, and unless you’ve been specifically tasked with appealing to outliers, you may glean little advantage from knowing how a master user engages with your product.
The more complicated a product, the more likely there is no one way to master it, and the more likely there is a broad range of user expertise you must cater to.</p>

<p>My company makes enterprise IT ops software.
Since I am not an IT ops agent monitoring a massive datacenter, I have little call to use our software the way our end users do.
Even as we use it to monitor our own company infrastructure, that&#8217;s not in my job description.
But that doesn&#8217;t mean I cannot seek out the perspective and pain points of users.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A major part of my actual audience is made up of Customer Success engineers and Field Sales engineers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;coworkers of mine who service customers with high-touch assistance.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It also just cannot be critical that we be able to “master” the product we document.
Take for example highly complex products like Photoshop or Drupal or Salesforce.
Proficiency with these products merely means you know how to figure out how to achieve things with them; of course it does not imply you already know everything there is to know, every permutation of every configuration or possible use case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This extends to consumer products as well.
I’d be willing to wager some of the video game docs you’ve seen were not produced exclusively by tech writers who had personally reached and killed the game’s final boss.
If you&#8217;ve ever read a video game walkthrough, however, you&#8217;ll see that technical writing can in fact demonstrate a breathtaking level of mastery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For enterprise or other business software products, we tend to see thoroughness in references, but not necessarily complete saturation in instructions.
The more divergent ways a product may be used, the more official documentation needs to teach users core elements of “how to fish”.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’re documenting a scripting language or a large, complex API, forget about it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you&#8217;ll still need to check your own docs at least once in a while, which is just fine.
Virtually all major contemporary programming languages arguably fit the bill of <em>too complex to truly master</em>.
This is mainly because languages develop methodological tribes around frameworks, integrations, conventions, and architectures.
In this way a thriving software language tends to grow exponentially, led in different directions by fresh thinkers with varying needs and preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, the risk of thinking fluently in any language is forgetting what it was like to find that language strange and off-putting.
The best instructors readily empathize with the uncomfortable, disorienting experience of learning an unfamiliar and possibly unintuitive system can be for the student.
The people who find your product’s interface intuitive may never look to your docs; they&#8217;re not your key audience.
Masters and poseurs have a tendency to kick over the ladder once they’re up, leaving newbies behind.

<p>I do believe many documentation projects would suffer a net loss overall in terms of quality if they were only documented by masters of that product.

They&#8217;ve come because they&#8217;re trying to get something done.
Either they&#8217;re habitual docs users or they&#8217;re looking for a specific solution.
In any case, your users' objectives are critical.</p>

<h3 id="_use_competitors_products">Use Competitors’ Products</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used to think only product designers and Sales and Marketing needed to be familiar with the competition.
Then I figured out all our customers were expecting our product to work like our dominant competitor’s offering.
The good news is that I can actually explore the world customers think they’re getting when they first crack open our product.
So informed, the theory is I can better ease the user’s transition from expectation to satisfaction, all without them so much as passing through the panic stage (at least so long as they open the docs on time).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using competitors’ products, you will learn about your own users.
Now you are visualizing your users’ expectations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does your product do something you call <em>parsing</em>, which your chief competitor has called <em>processing</em> for 10 years?
You may have good reason for it, and users may not care.
What they may need is to see the word <em>processing</em> somewhere in the sentence that introduces your <em>parsing</em> functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Does your product call for <strong>File menu:[&gt;] Export</strong> for an operation some competitors use <strong>File menu:[&gt;] Save</strong> to perform?
Again, you can be agnostic about which is better (I don&#8217;t even know what your product does), or you can be downright opposed to abusing “Export” the way you feel your engineers have.
All that matters for your docs is that you intervene gracefully where you expect new users might reflexively look, pointing them to the new home of the functionality they desire.
(This is good advice to pass on to product developers, as well, if quality assurance is a team-wide effort at your shop.)</p>

<p>In October 2015, the first time I met Rocana&#8217;s then-new Director of Product in person, he threw down a gauntlet.
He wanted me to see what our direct competition was capable of, and I was humbled by the artifact he handed me.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfolding in my hands on glossy card-stock, a splendrous 6-panel, 25"x11" reference spread made up of notations and tables, together conveying much of what is most needed by our competitor&#8217;s users throughout the day.
That user is also our intended user: an ITOps engineer or analyst.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Having been a hardcore nerd in my youth, I immediately notice this documentation concept is reminiscent of a Dungeon Master&#8217;s shield, a global quick-reference for the referee of a Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I know some of you are judging me right now.
Laugh it up&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;my hunch proved right!
Splunk senior technical writer Matt Ness gave a talk in which he explained the AD&amp;D-derived origins of this ingenious document.
But more pertinent to our purpose here, I beheld a form of documentation I will forever kick myself for not having done first.
Since I couldn&#8217;t deny the genius of the DM shield (including its marketing angle), it put me on notice that docs can make a real difference in our product&#8217;s specific space.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think I&#8217;m good at my job, and I hope Rocana edges Splunk out of our corner of the market someday, but I&#8217;m glad to know I&#8217;m up against a formidable counterpart.
The temptation to copy Ness&#8217;s innovation is great, especially when I consider the challenge of single-sourcing the whole thing right out of the product code repo.
For now, the Rocana shield waits; I&#8217;m headed in other directions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, but there are still startups today that do not emphasize a lean UX approach.
There can be virtually no doubt that early product testing and rapid iteration in response to validated and invalidated learning are critical; the days of inflicting a product blindly on a market are coming to a much-deserved end.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_docs_are_ux">Docs are UX</h4>

<p>Technical writers have to get on this train, even if that means hopping it without a ticket.

Anywhere users interact with the product is an interface.
This means command lines, installers, configuration files, plugins.
Good docs affect the user&#8217;s <em>experience</em> of every UI, and there is likely always a better way to reach the user in a given context.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve been told your documentation should make yourself invaluable to your employers.
You&#8217;ve been told that this should generally be done by heading off support requests from customers, or at least by providing Customer Support with a great reference for handling such requests from users who ignore the docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the truth is you should be providing a margin of value directly to customers.
For the end user, the technical writer alone&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more than the marketer or the UI devs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;can provide layers of appreciation for the product that cannot be articulated during a transaction.
Away from clicking and purchasing, the end user is most open to appreciate the application either (1) right before they begin using it or (2) when they realize a new level of the product&#8217;s complexity.
That is where solid technical writing comes in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good docs are ready with a sweeping overview for the intimidated new user.
For complex products or those requiring contextualization, some users head straight to the manual.
This means they&#8217;re not fully distracted by the developers' and designers' crafty handiwork.
Instead, <em>you</em> are more or less alone with the user.
Not to take ourselves too seriously, but good docs help close transactions and calls to action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good docs help experienced users avert or curtail frustration.
Coming to the rescue is fun.

<p>Here we begin a slightly more formal exploration of DocOps as a development and technical writing subspecialty.
More than establishing rules, these chapters lay the groundwork for solving complex documentation challenges in forward-thinking ways.</p>

<div class="quoteblock abstract">
<blockquote>
Codewriting refers to the different “codes” we use to communicate technical concepts, and the way we look at our overall approach to documenting software.
Codewriting is writing <em>about</em> software in a way that involves coding alongside the product, even if most of your source code is strings and prose.
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s no getting around it: codewriting requires deep knowledge of the specific product, and a functional knowledge of software more broadly.
Codewriters fully understand just about everything their product <em>does</em>, but they also have a firm grasp of how it is developed, by whom, using what assets and tools, in what environment.
Great codewriters understand the product build process, agile project management concepts, and developer interfaces (such as APIs and IDEs).
Even quality assurance, testing, and automation are on the codewriter&#8217;s radar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thinking like a coder means looking at the product from the inside out.
I don&#8217;t recommend this as a constant mindset; the end user&#8217;s perspective is far too critical to give way to the developer&#8217;s vantage.
But understanding the way devs look at code can be empowering, so let&#8217;s take a minute to brush up on (or brush against) basic computer science.
Don&#8217;t worry, I have no ability to go beyond the very surface, but there is plenty of insight in the basics of programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_code_abstraction">Code Abstraction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you can read machine code (you cannot), it does not matter how great of a software engineer you may be: humans require code abstraction in order to interface with computers.
This goes for programming as well as for using programs.
Even if you make a product for software developers, they want to work through an effective interface, be it a command-line interface (CLI), a graphical user interface (GUI), or an application programming interface (API).
All those <em>I</em>s are effectively sets of “fields”, “endpoints”, “commands”, “arguments”, or “hooks”, if not a full-blown scripting language.
With such interfaces, their human brains can train other pieces of software to interact with your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of code abstraction in rich text.
Say we&#8217;re trying to create a section title for a document, followed by some basic text.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>And because all those extra tags are not easy to type and only serve to limit our output options, we sourced this in lightweight markup, which converted to the HTML you see above.</p>

<p>For the three versions that concern us, the difference isn&#8217;t massive, but I can attest it took longer to type the HTML example, and I introduced a typo the first time through.
And I must say, even after twenty years of hitting <code>&lt;</code> hundreds of times a day, it&#8217;s still my least favorite key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same way a WYSIWYG editor is an abstraction of HTML (or other rich-text XML behind it), lightweight markup languages are an abstraction of that same complexity.
AsciiDoc was made to generate DocBook XML output.

It may seem like an arbitrary line to draw&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<em>I want to see lightweight markup, but I don&#8217;t want to see XML or bytecode</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but that&#8217;s my Goldilocks zone.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_abstraction_as_transformation">Abstraction as Transformation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most products and development environments involve much more complex forms of abstraction.
Even a website typically adds more layers, such as the cascading style sheets that provide layout form, fonts, colors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;pretty much everything but the content itself, down to all those boring HTML elements.
A large enterprise application can have numerous interfaces opening up countless avenues of source code giving way to machine code, which in turn forms numerous portals for developer, administrator, and end-user engagement with the product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All that is too big and frankly too abstract to grapple with, so let&#8217;s get back to a simpler example.
What if our product interface is bare bones?
Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re a new startup, and we&#8217;re hoping early adopters will validate our innovative tool at an early stage.
Maybe all we provide these early users is a command-line tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may not feel like it when you&#8217;re struggling at a command prompt, but a CLI is a layer of user-friendly abstraction, too.
You think commands and options are hard to keep track of, but they&#8217;re saving you from having to write and run scripts every time you want to interact with a product.
This may be difficult to appreciate, but engineers understand the advantage, as will anyone who learns to explore the <a href="https://github.com/briandominick/codewriting">Codewriting GitHub repo</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I started writing this book, I knew I&#8217;d want to make it extremely easy to publish your preferred version of this document, as well as show off some of the powers of DocOps tools.
I also wanted to reduce the number of steps it might take someone to build the book, which was kind of a pain in the butt at first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, I developed a tool called LiquiDoc, which provides a command-line interface.
(If you built this book from source, you&#8217;ve already used it.)
This LiquiDoc CLI abstracts a bunch of awkward logic you can learn about later, and that&#8217;s the whole story of why I coded it.
The script was so handy, I made a more robust version of it for work, and we released it as a Ruby gem, as well as opening up the source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Code abstraction” is a way of saying <em>a simplified interface to underlying complication and functionality</em>.
The <em>source code</em> developers write in is always an abstraction of underlying code.
Executable code is compiled or interpreted into another form, closer to being able to instruct the microprocessor to perform specific operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the developer is “done” with it (ready to test or package), source code becomes more complicated in order to interact with underlying layers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;perhaps a some libraries and precompiled dependencies, a runtime environment, the operating system, and then the microprocessor.
From all of this, your effort on that last layer yields a product that obfuscates all of the above, so the end user only sees what they need to&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;data and functionality are abstracted.
Just like our Markdown above gets uglier (HTML) in order that it may become more elegant (the browser display).
Sometimes specificity, performance, or functionality are sacrificed during abstraction, but a successful abstraction process creates at least a nominally new interface into a human-unfriendlier layer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_docs_as_merciful_abstraction">Docs as Merciful Abstraction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this sense, user instructions and other documentation are an abstraction as well.
Unless you’re writing docs for hardcore engineers (and not always even then, I imagine), there will be things you leave out in order not to increase the obscurity or complexity of your product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be tempting, especially on an open source product, to be fully transparent, even with internal notes, specifications, and other “work product” that often takes place in private spaces.
Unfiltered data gives creative and motivated users the potential to solve their own problems.
But consider all that potentially confusing if not contradictory or even hazardous information that would get out.
Ranging from user frustration to misinformation to potential liability, there is definitely such a thing as TMI in product documentation, even when your product is open source and highly extensible by design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a certain point, the sheer volume of docs achieves sharply diminishing returns, especially considering all released docs must be maintained.
A project can easily have more “documentation” files than it has originally contributed programmatic files, when you count all the meeting notes, task-management issues, support tickets, and whiteboard wars.
While adding only the most marginal value for edge-case users, too much detail can produce incalculable opportunities for typical users to get lost or discover bad information.
If your whole team operates in a public repo and task-management solution, maybe it&#8217;s okay that interested users can find what they need.
But there&#8217;s a difference between <em>exposing</em> and actually <em>releasing</em> documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll return to the discussion of curating content and managing internal docs.
For now, I wanted to demonstrate how <strong>docs are at once user interface and abstraction</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just like the product is.</p>

<p>So what is the set of functions a solid codewriter carries out that make us (think we’re) so special?
We fancy ourselves able to wear all the necessary hats to keep the docs in ship shape, no matter the pressures and obstacles we encounter.
This is partly because we&#8217;re skilled, but it&#8217;s mainly because we&#8217;re resourceful.
Either way, we exhibit more general intelligence, and at least marginally greater passion for our profession, than any computer program yet developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But let&#8217;s pretend for a moment that we&#8217;re just a fancy piece of AI software that can do a whole lot based on minimal commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Calling carryOut() as an abstract function</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">// Call our function
carryOut(user, act, target)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say this code <em>calls</em> a function named <code>carryOut()</code>, to which we are supplying arguments: the <em>values</em> of variables represented by <code>act</code>, <code>user</code>, and <code>target</code>.
Those arguments answer three questions the <code>carryOut()</code> function is just dying to know; we&#8217;re assured <code>carryOut()</code> can take it from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can’t see those values in this snippet, because they have been abstracted into <em>variables</em> (<code>user</code>, <code>act</code>, <code>target</code>) so the code we see above can be reused in different environments with different results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep it simple, let&#8217;s say we had previously set the values of those three variables like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Setting inputs for carryOut()</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">// Set our variables
user   = getObject("Wendy")
act    = "integrate-the-docs"
target = getObject("product/repo")
// Call our function
carryOut(user, act, target)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>carryOut()</code> function sees the <em>evaluations</em> of these arguments (user, act, and target); it interprets their values.
As we’ll see, this function expects some of these values to come in the form more complex abstractions called objects.
The <code>getObject()</code> function likely performs a database query or some other means of gathering contextual data and formatting such that other functions may manipulate it as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve figured out that this function instructs Wendy to integrate the documentation into the product repo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our abstract digital scenario, someone prepared the function <code>carryOut()</code>, which the code above is merely invoking.
The establishment of that function (so that it can be invoked) was another abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, the procedures you carry out to get your real-life work done are far more complex than their names imply.
The order to <em>diagram</em> a relationship between elements of a product suggests all kinds of specific wishes, which you must either infer, learn, or make up&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;often some combination of all three.
What you do not require is for some manager to point at your screen to tell you which programs to use, which menu items to click or shortcut keys to press, where to save the file in what format, and so on.

<h3 id="_docs_as_abstraction">Docs as Abstraction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good documentation is another layer of abstraction added to the product it covers.
It gives users (and potential customers) a view of the product that uses text and images to abstract all of that complicated software into a page or a table or a bulleted list that meets users where they&#8217;re able to interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its core, software technical writing is creating the ideal abstraction layer between users and the product.
Like a good UI, good documentation foresees the user&#8217;s needs and has the right information one click or one page turn away.
Even better than a well-written function, good documentation provides context inline, even as it references and links to heavy-duty references or further background.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also like a good function or method, docs are not meant to be read, but rather <em>executed</em>, which we considered in <a href="#chapter-writing-docs">Docs</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_writers_as_contributors">Writers as Contributors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If documentation is part of the product codebase, you are working like a developer every time you make a commit to the product repo.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re coming to codewriing from tech writing, maybe you haven’t looked at your work this way in the past.
Especially in the open source community, but really now throughout the broader software engineering field where collaboration is easier and more critical than ever, developers tend to think in terms of making “commits” to projects.
You’ll see open source participants referred to as “contributors” and “commiters”, including tech writers who work in the same repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I suspect this stems partly from the literal sense in which contributors are usually “committing” code to the source.
In perhaps most cases today, technical writers do not even use Git or another source-control tool, let alone are they working inside the product code repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For now, it’s more important to change mindsets.
Docs are part of the product, and tech writers are contributors&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;this is true even if they work exclusively in a Wiki or a conventional content management system well outside the product codebase.
Developers should not hold these terms as their exclusive domain even when they alone make commits to the source code.
Any devs doing this should consider remedying the dichotomy by bringing tech writers deeper into the Engineering fold.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_subject_oriented_writing">Subject-Oriented Writing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ve probably at least heard of “object oriented” programming (OO).
It’s a general category expressing the way a development language/framework is structured around acting on data objects, as well as the approach to developing software in that environment.
In OO, engineers can expect various elements of certain kinds to behave in specific, predefined ways.
Whether any given developer likes coding in OO is another matter; there is a closed, consistent logic to the approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technical writers have a much less exact task, which I argue can sometimes be harder to get just right.
We aren’t writing code to act on objects inside a closed system.
Very few of our sentences will throw syntax errors that require us to rewrite if we wish to proceed with publishing our docs.
Anyone who has tried to enforce grammar or style with a linter knows good writing can upset static observers; even <em>technical</em> writing is too artistic for such stringency.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also are the primary interpreter of input data, the flawed humans that we are.
We cannot program a system of explanation.
And unlike an operating system or an API, if our audience of <em>real humans</em> cannot make use of our part of the product, they will not throw what developers call a “graceful error”.
They may just throw a fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Subject-oriented writing is not what it may sound like.
I’m not using <em>subject</em> in the sense of <em>topic</em>; I am using it as the opposite of <em>object</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your audience is people, you cannot treat them as objects, the way a programmer can treat an API.
People are extremely complicated, meat-based computers that do not necessarily appreciate your language let alone your preferred syntax, yet you are expected to write for all of them in their various moods and modes.
In truth, users often reject your medium before they even give your implementation a chance.
(“I learn experientially; manuals are just for reference, at most.”)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can blame the audience all we want for not appreciating our hard work, but the truth is, we write material pretty much nobody truly wants to read.
The programmer never has to wonder this about her immediate audience, because it isn’t meat and thus has no sense of subjectivity, neither preferences nor opinions nor attitudes.
If the computer can interpret a language the programmer can write, the programmer never has to be concerned that the computer will be uninterested in compiling and running her software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The programmer need not wonder if the program may try to skip some steps depending on how close it is to lunch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The programmer does not have to name variables, objects, or methods creatively, just consistently.
She needn&#8217;t worry that her choice of a <code>switch</code> statement over an <code>if</code> statement may clash with Marketing&#8217;s preferences&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;those most impacted by her choices are usually close at hand.
And she sure as hell shouldn’t have to restate anything in her source code in order for the computer to “get it”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_yes_text_can_be_harder_than_code">Yes, Text Can Be Harder Than Code</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let me walk back that section title a little:
It’s rarely harder to <em>describe in text</em> the most complex software concept as it is to <em>program</em> anything complicated in code.
Also rare is the case that someone skilled at writing software is somehow unable to string words together coherently in their native alphabet (though I have seen this).
Conversely, most people who are adept at their mother tongue assume themselves unable to code their way out of a “Hello World” exercise.
Clearly, most of us think code is harder than text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, making a user manual <em>work</em> just as well as the software it accompanies can be at least as challenging as making the software itself, especially given the limited array of tools and dependencies at the documentarian&#8217;s disposal.
Product managers are less likely to give the kind of strict requirements and resources to docs that they convey to developers.
This can leave documentarians feeling rudderless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The difference is, people tend to overlook bad documentation if the product is good; in fact, a well-designed and executed product can reduce or eliminate the need for exceptional docs.
Great documentation makes using a product better&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;less frustrating, more rewarding.
If the product itself is great, the docs have to be that much better in order to provide a added value to the end user.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">A Docs Paradox</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have no fear that interfaces will suddenly, all at once cease to require auxiliary documentation, but I have to admit a product is likely better to the extent its interfaces reduce the need for documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is kind of a chilly realization for somebody staking his future on being an innovator in the technical docs space.
Even at Rocana, I find myself trying to innovate new ways to enhance the product UI with DocOps tooling, and I offer heavy feedback to the front-end and back-end teams as I explore and painstakingly document their interfaces (the web GUI and some CLI tools, respectively).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I look forward to a time when our product is so mature, the interfaces so intuitive, and our reference docs so well-maintained, that I&#8217;m able to spend most of my hours providing context and a sense of purpose to the product through use cases, knowledge base articles, advanced diagrams, and any other innovative means of expression or delivery.
I want to get into users' heads and have answers ready as questions reach their conscious minds.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentarians who produce poor docs often get away with it, even in this classic <em>You had one job…</em> scenario.
If you know a tech writer who says her job is easy, you probably know someone who is simply unchallenged at work.
Failing without anybody noticing is not the same as succeeding, even if it pays just as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exemplary technical documentation results from mindfulness of process and constantly addressing pain points and bottlenecks along the chain.
Whoever finds such a thing “easy” should have written this book in their spare time by now, saving me the trouble; I have found the job anything but easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout this book, we highlight some of the reasons for the quality divergence between a given product’s source code and its documentation, but one of the key factors is this difference in audience.
If you’re a developer trying to correct the way you’re instructing <em>software</em> to behave, you get immediate feedback on critical errors when you run tests, if not as you write.
The coder&#8217;s audience is specially crafted to cry out, hopefully in clear, informative ways, when the coder screws up&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;long before users get their hands on the product that source code eventually becomes.
In fact, a good developer takes great care to maintain an environment tailored to surfacing bugs before anyone from Quality Assurance sees them, let alone a customer or client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve been wondering all this time why I yearn to do software documentation the way coders do software development, let the previous paragraph serve as illustration.
We can&#8217;t change our audience, those meat-based subjects who keep our lights on, but we can make our relationship to users better align with developers' relationship to users.
That is, like coders, documentarians can enjoy environments that enhance and provide feedback on our output.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-coding-content">6. Coding Content</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I forgive you if you gathered from the previous chapter that I somehow diminish the relevance of the <em>developer</em> to their eventual human audience: the user.
This is, after all, the very same user that is the tech writer&#8217;s primary audience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The truth is, coders are always adopting new ways of ensuring their output meets users’ needs and expectations.
Good developers know they are <em>not</em> just finessing code for a digital audience that perfectly interprets it on behalf of the end user.
Those end-user meat computers we all serve are still going to interact with some kind of UI the developer&#8217;s source code ultimately generates, and interactive systems are hard to get right.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_content_development">Content Development</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product developers have spawned robust systems for user testing and feedback during all phases, from prototyping to post-shipping, all in order to ensure users get the most out of those developers’ work.
This may not be something we can precisely reproduce with early docs drafts or iterations, given the nature of our output and the potential for confusing real users.
But clever observers of product managers’ latest UX learning techniques have begun applying such “lean/agile” lessons to docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way the DocOps discipline can eventually establish processes and tooling to significantly reduce documentation bugs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;places where we get it wrong, or where our output falls short of expectations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the meantime, however, with even the best writing tools, there is no automated feedback mechanism that will flag a statement that disagrees with reality.</p>

This has become a generally accepted responsibility of programmers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reducing bugs in documentation is at least as important but poorly assisted.
Text editors and word processors have no idea about your context.

<div class="title">Dev vs Docs: the Environmental Advantage</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we discuss the concept of “DocOps”, we’ll delve farther into this analogy, but for now consider the tools developers have made available for themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmers use IDEs, which are code editors that live in the context of their development environments.
An IDE basically enables testing the product in real time, even as the developer works her magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, even the best text editors only give sentence-level insight on spelling or grammar.
We have to guess how it will be received by the reader.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don’t mean to exaggerate the power of the programmer’s IDE, either; it definitely does not tell her if her software will do what the user expects.
But in a properly configured environment, the programmer has a lot of advantages when it comes to finding bugs before they ship.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This parallel is a good illustration of the opportunities ahead for thinking in a DocOps mindset.
When will tech writers have what we need to predict how our work will be used and received?</p>

<p>An unforgiving but immediately responsive silicone audience is far and away more desirable than any meat-based audience; the latter are sure to be fickle, distant, even ornery.
Your organically eyeballed reader will move on with life; a REST API will wait eternally for a developer to send a properly formatted request.
Don’t let the coders you’re surrounded by convince you otherwise.
They think the reason you exist is that their time is more valuable spent writing in programming languages.
Prove you’re there to abstract their sparsely commented code and poor English notes into a more “human readable format”; that should shut them up.</p>

<p>We will discuss the above described threat much further in <a href="#part-5-evolution">[part-5-evolution]</a>; for now I just want to secure your attention.
In all honestly, I am pretty confident that I am helping to build a technical documentation infrastructure that may make it trivial for writing bots (coded by real engineers, mind you) to do a tremendous amount of our work for us&#8230;&#8203; or instead of us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news is, what makes a tech writer human is actually valuable to users, and thus valuable to our organizations.
Computers are probably a ways off from writing <em>interesting</em> docs that provide user-appropriate insights.
(Then again, so are most human tech writers.)
We&#8217;ll look at the hair-raising powers of existing AI later on, but the upshot will be the ironic ways such sophisticated and thorough routines do not appreciate abstraction the way we have come to.</p>

<p>Our job as tech writers, in two words or less, is to <em>explain interfaces</em>.
(You knew I wasn’t going to go for fewer than two words.)
I am tempted to say we <em>explain relationships</em> (to products), but that would be cheating.
The truth is, we think we document products, but it’s essentially only in terms of how they relate to their users or their context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you&#8217;re dryly listing the technical attributes of a product, you do this so the user can make better use of it.
Even if you&#8217;re merely explaining what the product <em>does</em> to some third-party (it <em>sends a message</em> or <em>it spits out confetti</em>), you are describing the way the product interfaces with something external.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don’t write for gift-buyers (consumer products) or purchasing agents (enterprise), conveying how and why the product will make their spouse or boss happy.

<p>Engineers are notoriously averse to writing documentation.
Except the many who are not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;those who do a diligent job pretty much every time, or who at least ensure technical writers have everything they need to produce good docs.
Whatever the case, if you&#8217;re taking an engineering approach to the docs, engineers may be more likely to approach the docs.
This is definitely what I and some others have found so far.</p>

<h4 id="_getting_engineers_to_contribute">Getting Engineers to Contribute</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your subject-matter experts probably do a fair bit of writing as part of their docs-related tasks.
That is, while you might get lots of information during real-time meetings, I bet for the most part you and the engineers whose work you document have found yourselves sharing quite a lot&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;especially the details&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;through digital, textual means.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re getting everything you need via e-mail, you may be beyond help.
More likely, notes come in through a project-management system or a file-management system&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;often both.
There may instead or also be a wiki involved, or perhaps a knowledge-base CMS for internal documentation integrated with Customer Support.</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever the system is, if it isn&#8217;t the product codebase, in or adjacent to the product repository using Git, then it&#8217;s probably a solid step outside their focus.

<p>When I talk to technical writers and engineers about lightweight markup languages, I typically get a version of one of following three responses:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>[Engineers] don&#8217;t want to learn another language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Engineers] already use Markdown on GitHub, StackOverflow, and a gazillion other places, so we should standardize around that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AsciiDoc sounds amazing! How soon can we switch to it from [anything else]?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the people reading this have probably worked with more engineers than I have in my career, much of which was spent hacking away nearly alone, but my experience the last 6 years or so just doesn&#8217;t bear the first two responses out.
The notion that developers balk at learning new languages used <em>with good reason</em> seems absurd to me.
This response was given to me off-hand by one of the engineers on my current team, but he picked up AsciiDoc gracefully; now he&#8217;s a fan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the combined sentiment of 1 and 2 in the words of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11293592">Hacker News commenter <em>zmmmmm</em></a>:</p>

<div class="quoteblock">

<p>Markdown has a lot of faults, but it solves the one single biggest problem in writing documentation that basically overrides every single other consideration: getting people to actually write it. Basically nothing else matters except this.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(This was in response to a posting of Eric Holscher&#8217;s “<a href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2016/mar/15/dont-use-markdown-for-technical-docs/">Why You Shouldn&#8217;t Use 'Markdown' for Documentation</a>”, which I recommend.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This commenter wants to have it both ways: the engineer has to write in a format helpful to the tech writer, but engineers can&#8217;t be bothered to learn a fundamentally superior language.
They must stick with the one they&#8217;re invested in: Markdown, the “language” they likely learned in under ten minutes total and do not consider a real language.
Engineers are notoriously against learning.
Right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The truth is, Markdown is not challenging enough for engineers who care about good docs; it is too limited, covering only elements all engineers know and could hand-code in HTML.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the actual elegance of Markdown translates directly or almost directly to AsciiDoc.
While there are more use-cases for Markdown, AsciiDoc is growing fast, and I believe it will effectively close the integrations gap, if not gain equivalent popularity among serious developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of technical writers think our job is to cater to the most reticent subject-matter experts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the ones we have to drag scribbled notes out of.
And I do cater to such developers; I treat them as kind of a separate case, at least until they come around.
I don&#8217;t complain about it, and I&#8217;m not sure I even mind it.
People contribute differently; it&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s the SMEs who want to contribute more fully or more directly that I build and curate docs solutions for.
The ones who recognize we can do great work together get a different kind of attention from me.
I don&#8217;t merely translate their rough notes into something a user can make use of.
They write and I enhance, or maybe I just review and copy edit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These coders who are reluctant writers know I have their backs.
They know I&#8217;m not going to publish bad writing; I&#8217;ll punch it up or edit for grammar and clarity.
They also know direct contributions are optional.
But enough of them are willing to venture into the docs‘ corner of the codebase and poke around that they can see the value in my methods, and maybe the value in helping me improve my tooling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some devs are never going to love contributing directly to user-facing docs, whatever their opinion of your markup choice.
Even engineers who hate directly writing docs are typically eager to get you what you need to do it.
Then move on and work more with the folks who want to take docs to a new level and leverage the power of collaborative writing and powerful publishing and delivery options.</p>

<p>Docs-as-code runs most of the same collaboration risks as programming source code does&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;namely the dreaded “merge conflict”.
And these can be extra frustrating when they involve blocks of text, as engineers constantly note while watching me wrestle with rough merges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A merge conflict comes about when two or more branches make changes to the same section of a file.
Resolving a merge conflict entails registering a preference&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a process made much easier by GitHub&#8217;s reconciliation tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The far bigger threat of poorly wrangled contributors is that they&#8217;ll make messes of your filesystem, naming conventions, and the like.
Somebody needs to referee the docs directories, and I&#8217;m afraid most of the docs-as-code systems lack great (or really any) content-management features of this kind.
If you love filesystems and don&#8217;t mind their limitations, you&#8217;ll do great.
Otherwise, you will find a significant part of your job involves manually enforcing taxonomy, organization, and naming conventions without the help of a CMS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is no small task, but it&#8217;s far from impossible.
At scale, it requires more wranglers coordinating with each other.
But at a certain scale, you should be able to devote some resources to developing tools that help manage the mess.

<p>Whether you&#8217;re a tech writer with some interest in coding or a coder who wants to do docs right, somebody is going to have to do some hacking.

<p>If your needs are at all complex, your DocOps system may similarly require a patchwork of various tools to form an appropriate platform.
Demands are so various that no tool is going to accomplish complex needs out of the box.
Perhaps 90 percent of software projects can be documented appropriately using out-of-the-box solutions.
These can still be docs-as-code, flat-file, Git-based frameworks or systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But for the rest, where the product or the customers or even just the dev team are somehow peculiar, your documentation environment may be multivariate.

They may do it, but they&#8217;ll never call it “fun”.
But if it looks like you&#8217;re having a great time putting together a documentation platform using some new open source technology they&#8217;ve heard of but never had an excuse to try out, they may grow interested in helping out when they can spare some time.

<h3 id="internal-docs">The Specter of Internal Docs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of technical writers only work with user-facing product docs, handling none of the developers’ internal specifications, resources, diagrams, and write-ups, except maybe using some of them as references after the SMEs are all done creating them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a mistake.
Tech writers and docs managers should play an active role in facilitating internal documentation.
I argue this for two critical reasons below, but first let&#8217;s explore what we mean by internal documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">    registries:
      - settings
      - reserved terms

    taxonomies:
      - glossary
    environments:
      - development

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps each of these already has a page in your team&#8217;s wiki.
Internal docs-as-code platforms are essentially flat-file wikis, usually built to static sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The codebase may be the sexiest part of the Engineering playground, but product quality requires a collaborative, resource-rich work environment.
Tools and resources should be at developers’ fingertips.
For example, there&#8217;s nothing gorgeous about IDE configurations, but engineers working in a common language using a common codebase and build infrastructure should be sharing their IDE configs.
It makes life easier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating and curating an attractive, tidy space where developers can contribute to common resources is a huge value add; making it possible for them to do this without leaving their favorite tools is showing them you care.
Make the tooling inclusive enough to encourage product and project managers, QA and DevOps engineers, the CTO, and the whole team to use it and use it properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also your chance to tutor Git and markup newbies.
Help them get comfortable with distributed source control and writing in flat files.
These are terrific professional skills; nobody has ever been harmed by having learned Git or a lightweight markup language.</p>

<dd>
<p>We&#8217;ll explore this potentiality in <a href="#engineering_docs">[engineering_docs]</a>, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning here as a key motivation for getting involved with internal docs.
At the very least, knowing what docs are floating around Engineering should give you some great ideas for supplementary resources users can make use of without too much extra work on your part, even if the material is only of marginal or novel interest.
The point is to consider every doc to have potential direct value to outside users, especially when at least some of those users are third-party developers looking to extend your platform.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Reason 2: Internal docs are an inroad.</dt>
<dd>
<p>I got my team interested in collaborative docs-as-code when I built a Jekyll-based website sourced in AsciiDoc flat files for our internal Engineering documentation.
The site is password protected, so it includes</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>official workplace policies to feature specs,</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once they saw the value of the system for their own needs, many of the developers started asking if they could provide their SME product content by directly contributing to the source.

<p>Even with its many qualifiers and wiggle words, I realize that is a bold statement, so let&#8217;s take a moment with it.
I definitely do not mean that every internal document will directly become a user-facing document.
(What a nightmare.)
But if it was worth creating in the first place, a technical document will eventually at least inform something in the product.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may not be an intuitive concept, but it&#8217;s been valuable to me.
We record institutional knowledge so that we can perform our jobs better inside that work environment.
But with software products&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unlike nearly anything else one can produce&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the value of ingredients often lasts beyond the current instance of this product.
It&#8217;s not just new designs based on existing designs; we&#8217;re talking about code and docs written on top of existing product source, forking and modifying it, typically supporting multiple versions at once.
New versions will be built on the same matter as the first, on down the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, software is made to allow its insides to be exposed.
Think of a good API.
Nowadays, good client-server development for web and mobile applications centers around REST APIs.
APIs aren&#8217;t just for third-party extensibility, either.
They&#8217;re best-practice architecture for proprietary/private parts of a company&#8217;s own product (such as the Web interface or mobile apps) that interact with core/common parts of the backend.
Facebook&#8217;s website and numerous mobile apps use the same API as Tinder programmers and share-on-FB widget developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There may be just as much or more of Facebook&#8217;s code that is kept entirely internal, but you can bet it&#8217;s developed using the same techniques.
Think about that: engineers are writing proprietary code as if they were building an external API, often fully documented and using highly logical user-facing endpoint paths and parameters.
Good development technique means interacting with your product the way you would want to see third-party developers and to some extent end users engage with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can and should lead to the slow release of hidden parts of the product, as their utility to outside users begins to catch up with that appreciated by core developers.
Private tools get open sourced or otherwise released: developer recipes and hacks can be exposed to third-party developers, metrics and test results can make their way to Marketing and others who can make use of them.
In fact sometimes the only thing preventing the release of internal tools to the open-source community is concern over support demands, which is usually a result of poor documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is all great news for documentarians.
All else being in order, more released product documentation is almost always better.
Of course, “all else” in this case includes good organization, indexing, and delivery systems, as well as respected security protocols, privacy measures, and regular content audits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most importantly, product code and docs code should be handled with care throughout their lifecycle, and as much of it eventually revealed as possible.
The best way to identify a piece of code or documentation that has reached the end of its lifecycle is to plan its management from birth onward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Graceful deprecation is a gift to developers and users alike.
We&#8217;ll discuss it more in <a href="#part-managing">Part Four: Managing</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This level of lifecycle anticipation means imbuing internal docs with an extra round of integrity during creation, editing, and upkeep, which may edge them that much closer to release or retirement.
Imagine all those benchmark notes taken during hours of rigorous performance testing, workarounds and patches that never quite qualified for official release, sample files used in development, responses to one-off inquiries from Support, Sales, or Marketing.
This is the stuff no bot is going to come up with any time soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t even have to directly monitor all the noise in Engineering, let alone actively curate and archive the signal; the trick is to set up systems so that all knowledge has a home and a trivial route to it.
Optimally, this is a system so consistent with your whole team&#8217;s existing routine that complaints over any effort needed to maintain it are outweighed by the benefits of maintaining it.
It cannot be frustrating or burdensome, and it has to pay off down the line.</p>

<div class="title">Releasing work product can be rewarding</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it doesn&#8217;t require much extra effort, selectively releasing "work product" can be a rewarding experience for many developers and support staff.
Even when just as uncredited as their source code contributions, developers like to see the fruit of their work get exposed and potentially make a difference to someone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This goes for nearly everyone at any company, all the way to the remote contractor&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;everybody wants to impact customers.
Look to team members you don&#8217;t work with as often, such as QA testers, automation and DevOps specialists, project managers.
Anyone who has information that might help users succeed with or extend the product is a potential source.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve encouraged DocOps best practices for internal documentation, lots of internal content should be one edit and review away from releasability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Release only what you can and will maintain.
Keeping track of all released documentation means <em>having a system in place</em>.
If you do this right, the amount of released material could grow exponentially, with a consistent flow between internal drafts to inclusion in released artifacts.
In the process, source material will undergo vetting, deprecation, pruning, distillation, and redaction as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make no mistake, however; getting this wrong can mean orphaned documents all over the Web and inside search engine indexes and users' browser bookmarks.
To some extent, this is just what we deal with; often the best we can do is keep every released document updated and readily available to users.</p>

Nobody questions the efficiency of this set of scripting rules.

<h3 id="_what_is_regex">What is Regex?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A regular expression is a way of describing a pattern using common characters in order to search for the described pattern in a body of characters.
The target can be pretty much any form of text, such as a conventional document or a flattened dataset.
A regex parsing engine uses these expressions to evaluate target texts for matches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Put differently by the regex-focused site Rexegg, “A regex is a text string that describes a pattern that a regex engine uses in order to find text (or positions) in a body of text, typically for the purposes of validating, finding, replacing, or splitting.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At its simplest application, think of regex as a much smarter version of the <code>*</code> or <code>%</code> wildcard symbols you&#8217;ve probably used in other contexts.
Where a conventional wildcard finds <em>any and all text</em>, regex can find shockingly detailed patterns without false negatives.</p>

<p>The string <code>codewriting.org</code> is matched by the following regex patterns:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]{1,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>.*@\.[a-z]+</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>codewriting\.org</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll note that all of these are more complicated than the non-regex search term:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>codewriting.org</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably in most cases of a find-and-replace task, I don&#8217;t get to use regex.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what if we needed to find all instances of <code>http://</code> protocol indicator for a <code>codewriting.org</code> URL in our docs and replace <code>http:</code> with <code>https:</code>.
We don&#8217;t want this for every instance of <code>http:</code> in the document, but we also cannot count on the domain string to always appear intact, as <code><a href="http://codewriting.org" class="bare">http://codewriting.org</a></code>, which we could easily replace with <code><a href="https://codewriting.org" class="bare">https://codewriting.org</a></code>.
Making matters more complicated, numerous instances of a <code>codewriting.org</code> url appear with a hostname or “subdomain”, such as <code>docs.codewriting.org</code>.
To make sure we caught them all manually, we&#8217;d first have to create a list, and then iterate through it one by one replacing the whole string.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the simple regex pattern that will save us all this trouble:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-regex" data-lang="regex">http\:\/\/([a-z]+\.)?codewriting\.org</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This regex would efficiently match the following strings:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code><a href="http://codewriting.org" class="bare">http://codewriting.org</a></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><a href="http://git.codewriting.org" class="bare">http://git.codewriting.org</a></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><a href="http://staging.codewriting.org" class="bare">http://staging.codewriting.org</a></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The single set of parentheses in the regex will capture any group it matches and store it as a variable we can later reference to reinsert the captured string.
The <code>$1</code> in the following replace string represents the first (and only) group captured in each of our examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>https://$1codewriting.org</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>$1</code> will insert whatever was captured for each instance: either an empty string, <code>git.</code>, or <code>staging.</code>.
Therefore, one find/replace procedure will handle the whole fix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above pattern assumes I know that all subdomains are lowercase letters (<code>[a-z]+</code>), or it would get more complicated (<code>[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+</code>).
This pattern indicates a single alphanumeric character followed by any combination of alphanumeric or the <code>-</code> symbol, the only allowable format for hostnames.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say for some reason we also have various top-level domains in addition to different subdomains.
Maybe we also bought <code>codewriting.net</code> and have different apps running on different hosts, and our docs need to reflect the distinction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to upgrade our pattern to catch these new variations.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-regex" data-lang="regex">http\:\/\/([a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.)?codewriting\.([a-zA-Z]{2,})</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can match several new patterns that we were unable to previously, along with a second group for reflecting the top-level domain.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code><a href="http://codewriting.org" class="bare">http://codewriting.org</a></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code><a href="http://git.codewriting.org" class="bare">http://git.codewriting.org</a></code></p>

<h3 id="_why_and_when_to_use_regex">Why (and When) to Use Regex</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make no mistake about it, regular expressions are a labor-saving tool.
They are for automating routines.
They either save you time or they are not worth the effort of writing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to these everyday use cases, it&#8217;s not always clear that employing regex will actually save you time.
It will almost certainly be <em>more fun</em> to spend even an hour trying to write just the perfect expression that catches everything you want and nothing more.
Remember, the alternative is performing a routine task with numerous slight variations, change after manual change, without introducing any errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Of course errors can be introduced by improperly written regular expressions, but these mistakes tend to be consistent: they can be tested for and fixed using&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you guessed it&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;regex.
Errors introduced manually are more likely to vary.
You may someday discover having mistyped <code>"</code> as <code>'</code>, but elsewhere another typo: <code>''</code>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Still, that hour-long regex challenge will only save you time if manually finding and replacing every instance would take more than an hour to accomplish, with the added fact that you might introduce mistakes and not catch them.
(You&#8217;d really want to use regular expressions to catch those mistakes, which begs the question.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s more, as with pretty much all open-ended task work, estimating the difficulty of writing a regular expression to solve a one-off problem can be challenging.
I readily admit I have on numerous occasions spent more time struggling with a regular expression than I would have saved if I&#8217;d nailed it outright.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, I think overall it has saved me hundreds of hours on day-to-day one-off tasks, including dataset migrations and HTML refactoring.
But when regex is used to automate a routine task you&#8217;d otherwise have to start and repeat on a regular basis, the value can become immeasurable.
We&#8217;ll explore such a case in Part Four.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suffice it to say, becoming wise about the up-front burdens imposed by regex is important, but any serious documentarian is bound to encounter cases where the right regex will save critical hours, or at least tedious hours.
So let&#8217;s demystify this powerful tool before you&#8217;re expected to put it to use on a real-world task.</p>

<p>Getting back to the task at hand, we&#8217;re essentially just trying to rearrange some things.
But those basic changes render standard find and replace nearly useless.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quite usefully, a regex pattern can store portions of matches as variables for insertion during a subsequent procedure.
Wrapping pattern groups in parenthesis indicates that we want to store the captured content as a variable.
By default, these groups are tokenized numerically and can be expressed later as <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an appropriate regex pattern to flexibly match these entries, including discrete portions of the content, which we want to carry over in a new arrangement.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Regex matching string with capture groups</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This probably looks both sloppy and intimidating.
I still find these big patterns a bit challenging to read, let alone write, but regex isn&#8217;t that hard to get comfortable with.
I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m not enjoying the shock value, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are attempting to capture four groups wrapped in <code>( )</code>.
Meanwhile, we&#8217;re ignoring a fifth group (the one with the <code>Defaults to</code> string in it), as we have no use for that text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve captured your groups, writing the parsing template is relatively straightforward.
Simply use the <code>$n</code> token, where <code>n</code> is the capture order slot for that variable.
This way they can be reproduced out of order.</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Regex replace template for find/replace operation</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>\n</code> token denotes a newline marker, of course you see four numbered group tokens we discussed a moment ago.
The rest of the markup you&#8217;ll recognize from our AsciiDoc.
Let&#8217;s look at what this find/replace operation produced&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you&#8217;ll recommend most of the other replacement template in here.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not perfect.
We&#8217;ll still need to do another round or two to get it how we need it to look.
But you&#8217;ll see now why I captured the <code>.</code> character in <code>Optional.</code> and <code>Required.</code>.
Our next move will be to run a simple (non-regex) find and replace procedure on the string <code>Required.</code>, which will miss the <code>Required</code> in <code>Required:::</code>.
We want to replace <code>Required.</code> with <code><strong>Yes</strong></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we can replace <code>Optional.</code> with <code>No</code>.
Now our document matches our target format precisely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What did we save ourselves?
It obviously depends on how hard it was to create the patterns.
As soon as you get them right, you&#8217;re pretty much done.
And we did not have to manually remove quotation marks, insert carriage returns, numerous newlines, that repetitive <code>+</code> symbol, and all those infernal colons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a bonus, we got to solve a cool little puzzle!
Seriously what more could a technical documentarian ask for?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proficient use of regex does not require memorization of all regex patterns&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they can always be looked up.
Besides, you&#8217;ll use the same handful of character combos most of the time, adapting common patterns to your specific content or data scenario.
Getting the concepts right early on is far more important than memorizing symbols, so let&#8217;s start there.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Regex in .htaccess</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another powerful real-time use case for regular expressions is in the <code>.htaccess</code> file lots of us have used when we&#8217;ve needed to deal with website managing URLs on Apache-based webservers.
This file, stored in the site&#8217;s root directory, would be checked every time a request came to the site.
If aspects of the request matched patterns we designated in that file, the browser would be redirected as we saw fit.
We use this to force all browsers to use HTTPS protocol, or when URL paths change and we want to redirect browsers and search engines to the new address.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;.htaccess rewrite</div>
<div class="content">
<pre>RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://example.com/$1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the requested server port is <code>80</code>, the connection is insecure.
The next line commands the resetting the request URL by capturing everything in the URL path after the home directory.
So if the request is for the URL <code><a href="http://example.com/some-path/index.html" class="bare">http://example.com/some-path/index.html</a></code>, and the <code>.htaccess</code> file is in the domain root directory (<code>/</code>), the above <code>RewriteRule</code> captures all text (<code>.*</code> matches <em>any content</em>) from the beginning of the string (<code>^</code>) to the end (<code>$</code>).
The parentheses indicate content to capture and store in a variable&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in this case, <em>everything</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our sample URL, this will have matched <code>some-path/index.html</code>, which we now want the webserver to append to anther call to our domain, this time using HTTPS protocol.
The next string is our explicit root domain followed by <code>$1</code>, the token that indicates we want to insert the our first captured string (in this case, our only captured string) right in that spot.
Our URL becomes <code><a href="https://example.com/some-path/index.html" class="bare">https://example.com/some-path/index.html</a></code>.</p>

<h3 id="_assuring_accuracy">Assuring Accuracy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m going to make a frightening suggestion to shock you a bit, only to walk it back slightly right afterward:
<em>technical documentation managers should own product accuracy</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right, so I don&#8217;t mean we should take on quality assurance&#8217;s job of making sure the released product meets specifications.
I mean documentation should consider maintaining the state of what the product requires and supports, not just what it does.
Let&#8217;s face it, we end up being the last ones checking whatever spreadsheets whomever is keeping to track what is going into the product.
At some point, pretty much everybody has had hands on certain kinds of references: Product Management, project managers, at least one developer, maybe testing/QA, maybe even you if you came across it and got fussy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_references">References</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Documentation of this nature is a good candidate for evaluating different systems to see what works now (and will be most likely scale) with your team.
This is strictly objective material&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;product metadata, if you will&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;about which there is a discernible truth: currently supported versions, current third-party integrations, licensed dependencies, known limitations.
In other words, product metadata is pretty much anything that is falsifiable about how the product fits into its market or ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One collaborative platform will be more effective than the others in enabling your team to establish canonical documentation which aligns with existential truth.
That is, documentation that is definitive and accurately reflects reality.
If you have to allow Markdown, Excel, or WYSIWYG tools to ensure participation, just find a way to respect the "everything in code" mantra, and set up whatever tools will suit the task.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_diagrams">Diagrams</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another place where unifying engineers, product managers, and technical writers could be critical is maintaining internal and customer-facing diagrams.
Any depictions of product architecture, workflow, and so forth, are prime candidates for complex collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you use UML (Ascii text-based diagram markup), OmniGraffle (full-featured diagramming WYSIWYG with XML source), or something in between, the key again is "everything in code".
Reviewers should be able to clearly see what has changed in a revision, and everyone needs to be able to contribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keeping basic, canonical diagrams is more critical than teams realize.
Visualization is one of the best ways to establish cohesion of understanding internally.
This is where developers and product managers will often surface the different ways they see a product.
Standardize the way your organization does diagrams, and choose a tool with which everyone can at least tinker, if not create.</p>

<p>Engineers typically expect technical writers to work around them.
Tech writers tend not to have much power in the situation.
I cannot stress enough how important it is to minimize disruption to developers' flow, even though sometimes disruption is precisely what is called for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you track developers' work in a project management system (including a Kanban board or other dashboard-style objective instrument), you have probably found a systematic way to communicate with developers through it.
I won&#8217;t go into the boring details of our solution, but we use JIRA, configured with a field for <strong>Release Notes</strong>, which will be exported to source prior to compiling the docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our JIRA also has an issue type called "Docs Sub-Task", which is a way for engineers to create stubs, assigned to themselves, for documenting work that is scheduled or underway.
This way, I can see these tickets in the pipeline as flags for work that should be hitting my desk soon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an elaborate alternative to tagging the work ticket "Needs Docs" or something.
In our case, we need a way to ensure code tickets don&#8217;t get closed until their associated documentation work is ready, but we also do need a place for the developer to stick their notes.
The next iteration of this system that we&#8217;ll test will hopefully lighten the load.</p>

<p>Some professional writers have horror stories about subject-matter experts treating them like assistants.

I get it that not all are lucky enough to find themselves working with teams that highly value or elevate documentation.
There are different ways to approach this problem that may work better in various organizations; I would not purport such problem-solving among my skills.
However, I do know something about helping engineers see documentation differently than they&#8217;ve come to expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time a new engineer joins the team, I ping him or her on Slack and schedule a sync up.
I present a bit about how I approach documentation, as well as what is expected from them.
I want them to appreciate early on that my job is to help them do two of the parts of their job they wish could be automated: <em>accessing local knowledge</em> and <em>documenting their own code</em>.
I also make it clear that I get purchase for the requisite initiatives from their support for and engagement with my procedures and technologies.</p>

I need them to see the devs are doing more of the work in Java, JavaScript, and Golang that make up the digital assets we&#8217;re selling.
All of that research, coding, and testing has truly exponential value, and the docs are just there to make sure that value can be realized.
That&#8217;s humility I have, and it&#8217;s perspective I don&#8217;t mind Product having, as long as they appreciate that the docs form a critical layer, if not a profit-magnifying one.</p>

<p>The other constituency I deal with directly is made up of engineers in our Customer Success department, as well as the Sales Engineers who have first contact with our end users.
These are my primary audience, in fact; they are often literally on site with our customers while our end users engage with the product, and that means my docs need to minimize if not eliminate embarrassing frustrations.
It&#8217;s not unusual for a support engineer to check in with me just before a release to ask if there are any surprises, or to make sure some aspect of the product was updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My docs are truly for this situation, if they&#8217;re for anything at all.
When a highly paid product mentor from my own company is shoulder-to-shoulder with a user in a customer&#8217;s IT department, both following along with my Reference Guide.
I want them to find what they need, where and when they need it, and of course I want them to find only accurate information, consistent wherever and however it is presented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These men and women are also often the first to discover bugs in my docs, which is of course invaluable for me.
The field teams need a responsive system for submitting documentation bugs, and I need them to feel empowered to contribute heavily and directly to resolving docs bugs.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That may sound like a lot of pressure and a lot of varying interests to satisfy, and I admit that&#8217;s often how it feels.
Whenever this task feels like I&#8217;m exploring some uncharted territory of technical documentation, I just remember I work on a team that includes ReactJS coders, a machine-learning engineer, a whole bunch of Big Data platform engineers, and DevOps engineers (don&#8217;t tell them I called them that&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s complicated).</p>

<p>Note consistency of these three interests just among my collaborators.

If I maintain and facilitate good docs, everybody wins, even if almost nobody notices.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Discussion Boards</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once upon a time, and still more often than I can bear, bulletin boards and discussion forums were used in the service of documentation.
When used to solicit participation and feedback which in turn informs and improves official documentation, such as managed knowledge bases, use cases, and tutorials.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, however&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and let&#8217;s face it, drearier times&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;discussion forums are used as the docs themselves.
Maybe a developer initiates threads in some of the channels, but each becomes a free-for-all of guesses and what-ifs, sometimes spiraling into flame wars.
These arrangements become ne&#8217;er-pruned unofficial knowledge bases, mixing support requests with complaints, bad user advice with tardy official advice.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">IRC</dt>
<dd>
<p>IRC channels are ephemeral, flowing, and conversational formats, where one might expect to find an edge-case request mentioned, but no one would think to consider a sacred source of truth, something more valuable can be built.
They are relatively anonymous, and somewhat hit or miss.
Nevertheless, they always seem to have an authentic feel.
A lot of times you get direct, realtime and symmetrical dialog with somene central to the project you need help on, right when you need that help.
There&#8217;s something to be said for that.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The limitations of IRC are obvious.
The more recent wave, with chat platforms like Gitter and Slack, product teams are interacting with extension developers and users in real time, with some sense of organization, flow, and a reliable archive.
It seems to me these contemporary tools haven&#8217;t necessarily attracted the trolls or the Google-overloading wastelands that stale Discussion Board pages become.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, I&#8217;m not sure I would include this category as documentation.
Even if technical writers participate from time to time or derive content from such sources, I maybe it&#8217;s lack of permanence or adherence to SOARCE disqualifies it.</p>

Technical content isn&#8217;t only complicated from the macro perspective we took in the previous chapter.
Discrete content items can themselves be highly complex, like little clusters of data stored in a routine format, all of it yearning for expression in application code and user docs.
In this chapter we&#8217;ll take a strategic look at handling complex content, including DRY single sourcing, validation, and collaborative workflow management.

<h3 id="_the_challenge">The Challenge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Handling what I call complex content objects (CCOs) is one of the biggest challenges faced by a team dealing with lots of distinct, structured content items.
I don&#8217;t mean “chapters” or “topics”, as in the ways we modularize tech docs.
Instead, consider all the secondary and tertiary types of content you need to maintain and reuse to provide <em>references</em> for users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of reusable content items such as data your team is keeping in a spreadsheet right now&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the kind of content you wish you could port directly from engineers' internal documentation to your user-facing docs or UI, with just-in-time copy editing performed to boot.
If that engineers' reference spreadsheet has two or more <em>columns</em>, then each <em>row</em> is a CCO.
Each such spreadsheet is a <em>collection</em> of CCOs.</p>

<p>The most obvious one is to generate the glossary at the back of this book, which it does.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That markup is perfectly fine, and in fact it is the form the Glossary started in when I first began writing this book.
The only real problem with storing content/data in this format is it&#8217;s not portable; only AsciiDoc tools can do anything with it out of the box, and there aren&#8217;t many AsciiDoc tools that focus on manipulating complex content objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if I wanted to be able to transform these glossary terms where they actually appear in the body of my book&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;everywhere <em>except</em> the glossary itself?
Perhaps I want to highlight the terms wherever they appear in the main text, so if users hover over or click on them, they&#8217;ll see the definition in a tooltip above the word.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, I need a convenient way to handle and reformat just the term I need.
AsciiDoc is not very helpful here, since it does not provide content to external tools as defined, semi-structured data like data-focused markup such as XML, JSON, and YAML.
Already, we&#8217;ve discovered a reason we should look at storing <em>all</em> discrete, parameterized content as semi-structured or structured data.</p>

<p>This is not the first or most-common consideration, but I think it should be among them.
Since this is a major shortcoming of the RDB model, it is a place where flat-file approaches might shine.
This is the inclusion of variable data inside a datasource, especially for cumulative inheritance of values set in a linear fashion.
Give me a moment to explain:
In source code, parameters are often built cumulatively.</p>

<h3 id="_solution_approaches">Solution Approaches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a codewriter, I&#8217;m always leaning for the flat-file approach, but as you can see, it&#8217;s not always going to make sense.
Before we settle on the flat file, let&#8217;s seriously consider some other options.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_relational_databases">Relational Databases</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your background is in website development or content management systems, the solution may seem obvious.
As recently as a couple years ago, I would have solved this with a relational database.
Structured Query Language is not just a way of inserting, updating, and retrieving data in a relational database;
it can also express the proper schema of a data object.
After all, a database table is basically a container for data objects, and the container is eminently configurable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One major problem with the RDB solution is version control.
Source-control systems like Git don&#8217;t work to track the innards of relational databases, which tend to use binary files.
Git has no insight into the structure of your conventional RDB file, so it cannot track changes made to the data.
Therefore, an RDB will also require specific version tagging of any version-sensitive data, a layer of manual complexity that is fairly prohibitive.
One of the reasons we&#8217;re doing docs-as-code in the first place is so that we can associate our single-sourced product info with the version of the product to which it applies</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other major limitation of using RDBs for a constantly changing array of datasets is the interface.
RDBs require query transactions to access data, including for reading and writing.
This can be abstracted into form interfaces, as with a traditional CMS, but then that CMS has to be administered and maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good, open CMS platform such as Drupal provides your product build system with REST API access to your human-maintained data.
So if you are willing and able to maintain such system, an external CMS can work with a docs-as-code solution.
If the demands of your product will be relatively static&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;meaning, no new forms of complex data popping up all the time, maybe an RDB plus a web-based interface and straight JDBC/SQL on the back end can solve your needs.
As an old hand with Drupal and WordPress, I always consider a dynamic, server-side solution when I encounter a new challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the factors mitigating the RDB-backend and web-UI solution are very strong compared to the relative freedom and ease of a flat file.
Sure, you&#8217;d never open a flat-file datasource to just any user, but in a professional environment with a proper workflow in place for vetting new content, flat files are superior low-volume datasources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dita_ccms">DITA CCMS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The DITA system&#8217;s <strong>specialization</strong> feature can be used to define and maintain CCOs.
So DITA platforms naturally come ready to handle this issue using an elegant interface with XML “under the hood”.
I&#8217;d call that a pretty significant advantage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One limitation of these systems is they require special tools: editors that manage content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most DITA CCMSes seem to use relational database back ends, though some now handle flat-file storage and integrate nicely with Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether content is stored in an RDB or in flat files, the platform is enhanced by a database-backed content-management interface.
The advantages of this are significant, including powers for reorganizing content that are tedious and clumsy to do with conventional file-management tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, those special tools really do add expense and weight.
License fees range from $50 to hundreds of dollars a month <em>per seat</em>, making it prohibitive to involve all SMEs as docs contributors.
Despite my idealistic description above, these tools also tend to be somewhat clunky, and they are very much Windows-oriented.
Engineers tend to dislike clunkiness and Windows, not coincidentally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Localization and translation management are another major advantage of DITA-based systems.
If you need to generate documentation in multiple languages and do not wish to reinvent this (very complicated) wheel, proprietary CCMSes or major open source CMSes are probably your best options.</p>

<p>an internal Knowledge Base where hidden configuration settings and troubleshooting advice can be accessed by engineers and support agents, but not necessarily all end users;</p>

There are ways to sensibly “join” two semi-structured data files the way an RDB joins tables, but it&#8217;s clunkier than a system with a true database backing it.
If you have files named <code>people.yaml</code> and <code>jobs.yaml</code>, you&#8217;re going to have an uphill battle keeping people associated with their jobs, and jobs associated with the people performing them.
It&#8217;s not an impossible problem to address down to this layer of complexity, but only a real product-development process will nail the architecture, interface, and query language for handling such relationships for highly complex small data in flat files.</p>

It may also be the best option for keeping your docs in great shape, so argue for it if you need to.</p>

With CI, the product build will just call a script, and those files will be generated during the build, then compiled along with the rest of the docs as if they&#8217;d been sitting there all along.
If you are not authorized or confident enough to hack the build, maybe you can recruit a DevOps/automation engineer to champion this level of real-time integration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the real coup is when engineers start using your semi-structured data files as source libraries for their product code.
If an engineer is hacking your YAML file to document a configuration property, including its metadata (data type, constraints, required status, etc), why wouldn&#8217;t that engineer just use your YAML file as the <em>source</em> of that metadata to help define their code?
Any YAML file can be a library or data source for other aspects of the product.
This is how we establish canonical data in DRY, single-sourced complex content systems.</p>

As with the rise of development frameworks and agile methodologies over the past 15 years, so too can technical documentation enjoy a comparable (if humbly proportionate) renaissance of writing approaches and tooling strategies.

<p>To use a cringe-worthy term, <em>thought leadership</em> is sparse in the technical documentation field.
This has shocked me during my brief tenure practicing the craft.
I can&#8217;t help seeing irony in the lack of accessible writing about how to do documentation right.
When coders stepped out of their closed-source silos and joined the revolution about 15 years ago, technical writers largely stayed behind.
Those who have been doing it “right” so far seem to have uncharacteristically largely failed to share their successful strategies and tactics, myself included.</p>

<p>If DocOps is to emerge (perhaps under some better name) as a concrete methodology we can more clearly instruct, it must undergo rigorous field testing and collaborative iteration.
<em>Codewriting</em> is one step in the development of a mature framework for wrestling complicated software products into comprehensible clusters of coherent descriptions, illustrations, instructions, and inspirations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then delivering them to users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Writing a book in a pubic repo is my attempt to nudge the field forward in its mindset.
We&#8217;re a bunch of grown ups used to corralling testy engineers and conjuring stale prose to earn a crust; of course we can collaborate with fellow pros to co-write a user manual for a next-gen docs methodology.

<h3 id="_foresee_the_threat">Foresee the Threat</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where we get back to the threat posed by automation.
You might think I&#8217;m joking, and it is indeed a strange topic for a tech-writing book, but in truth, very soon (surely within 10 years) it will become possible to automate a significant portion of technical writing effort without a major loss of overall quality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you think I am exaggerating, look at what powerful AI instances such as DeepMind and Watson are already doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google&#8217;s DeepMind is able to learn to play and defeat video games just by using the pixels on the screen and employing advanced trial and error to figure out the rules and “physics” of the game.
With no docs to read and no insight into the product not available to an actual end user, a machine can perfectly learn a complicated program.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DeepMind meanwhile likely has no ability to explain what it sees, let alone to determine what to share with a user vs what to leave for them to figure out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IBM&#8217;s Watson <em>can</em> read docs, and it can establish what looks like contextualized understandings of complicated matters of fact and even concept.
It can also generate seemingly original summary output based on relatively complicated and highly diverse inputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kind of feedback a screen-viewing, trying-and-erring bot like DeepMind will provide, converted to some reporting format, would be of incalculable value to GUI developers.
QA engineers will be all over tools that can <em>use</em> software via the front-end interface.
The minute some smart-ass QA engineer decides to hit btn:[print] while using DeepWatson to debug an app, stock in my trade goes way down.
Once the machine&#8217;s observations are expressed as descriptions of on-screen occurrences, tech writers get an amazing tool, and also possibly lose some coworkers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will likely reach way beyond the world of software docs, since nearly all products are digitally engineered today.
Any product whose source and specs can be read is subject to at least partially automated documentation.
In a just world, that would be exciting&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it sounds like we get tools to alleviate the more routine aspects of our gig so we can focus on the more interesting stuff anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Except the world isn&#8217;t just; bosses will always hog the profits afforded by innovations.
They aren&#8217;t going to keep funding tech writers and docs managers out of the goodness of their hearts.
Some might reallocate writer resources to get way better docs on top of such new tools, but I expect most will want cheaper adequate docs.
That means big layoffs with better tooling, even if someone will always need to be around to run them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My inclination is to call for overthrowing capitalism, but I can&#8217;t explain that strategy in these pages.
We&#8217;re stuck with becoming invaluable to our teams, or maybe to professionals in some less-technical field who need DocOps hackers to establish and instruct collaborative docs environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won&#8217;t be alone among the slashed.
Only the best tiers among our software developer friends&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the ones who innovate chaotically and radically&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;will make it all the way to the Singularity as professional engineers.
Technical writers' half life may already have been spent.
The good news is, if you are reading this particular document, you are almost certainly in the group that can&#8217;t be so easily replaced: the ones who actually <em>care</em> about excellence in technical documentation.
As of yet, no machine can be programmed to desire to improve a user&#8217;s life (or their day or minute) by helping them connect with a product they believe they need to use.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t we be better off if our Robot Overlords had to slog it out with Microsoft Word or some Adobe product that still comes on CD-ROM?

<p>Think about it: to the extent technical writers are copying/pasting, categorizing, styling, and testing engineers' notes and comments, we&#8217;re talking processes ripe for automation.

<h4 id="_organize_resources_in_the_source">Organize Resources, in the Source</h4>

<p>Continuing on the internal-docs theme, perhaps the most beneficial act would be to centralize complex resources, storing it all in source where it&#8217;s most useful to engineers.
I&#8217;m always shocked at how few teams do this, until I&#8217;m reminded how significant the challenge is.
I&#8217;ve spoken with documentation consultants who were baffled by the very notion that I would attempt to crack this nut; many of them had never even considered it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is commonly addressed by docs specialists, but the truth is, reference resources are a huge problem for engineers.
Teams have recently flocked to cloud-based solutions like Google Docs &amp; Drive or Zoho, which enable real-time collaboration on all kinds of docs, including spreadsheets.
This way multiple members of the same team, or even multiple teams across the organization, can maintain complicated, layered listings of commonly required data.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_we_lack">What We Lack</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To my knowledge, no truly integrated documentation tool is openly available today.
Before you suggest your favorite IDE or CCMS, let me explain a little more of what I mean by <em>truly integrated</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine the following: You are typing along in your favorite lightweight markup language (let&#8217;s call it AsciiDoc), and you need to express the default value of something.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example value expression in AsciiDoc</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">The default value of *login.allowed-attempts* is `3`.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a reminder, those asterisk and backtick markers are just for formatting bold and literal, respectively.
That whole line is static code, but it is <em>about</em> something dynamic.
It&#8217;s <em>subject</em> is <em>dynamic</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what happens when this default changes in the product codebase?
Typically a tech writer has to be notified, or they must discover the change during a review of some external database/spreadsheet where settings and their defaults are tracked.
In any case, the tech writer has to manually make the change republish the docs or wait for the docs to publish.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would obviously be better to use a variable here, especially if this default is going to be expressed in any second place anywhere in the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example value expression in AsciiDoc</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-asciidoc" data-lang="asciidoc">The default value of *allowed.login.attempts* is `{login_allowed-attempts__default}`.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, that looks a little bit better, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem of requiring someone to change the value of the AsciiDoc variable <strong>login_allowed-attempts__default</strong>, wherever it is defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now imagine that variable is sourced from a common registry which is edited by the developer when the default for the core setting <strong>login.allowed-attempts</strong> was changed.
Suddenly your intervention is no longer needed on the trivial matter of a changed setting value, because the value of your AsciiDoc variable (login_allowed-attempts_default) is drawn from that registry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a mature integrated docs environment, possessing potentially robust awareness of the product once integrated.
Such a system could incorporate unit tests and regression tests to ensure the docs always reflect the proper value of an existing parameter compared to the version of the software each docs edition describes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_docs_generators">Docs Generators</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The embedded documentation generators associated with various programming languages are an important cousin to my idea of an integrated docs environment, and they&#8217;ve been around for quite a while.
Systems like JavaDoc, PyDoc, YARD (Ruby), Perldoc, JSDoc, phpDocumentor, and several others essentially transform developers' structured code comments into automated documentation output.
This form of docs-as-code has been around for many years, and it is extremely useful.
But it is also notoriously limited, as it is more like a code-as-docs or a docs-<em>of</em>-code solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both Swagger and Doxygen are excellent black boxes that take complicated inputs and produce well-structured, predictable output.
They can meet developers on their turf, deep inside the codebase.
Working with such tools requires up-front planning, configuration, and testing, but it can be worth it for the developer proximity they enable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But embedded and integrated docs generators are just not good enough to produce great user-facing product docs.
These tools are more oriented toward users who need to know how to interface with or directly hack a product&#8217;s inner components.
So while these embedded generators may suffice for producing API docs or developer references, they don&#8217;t necessarily correspond in any direct way to the end-user interface.
For most products with GUIs, source code and interface do not line up 1:1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides, engineers are less than keen to have tech writers poking around in their source files.
Surely any engineers reluctant to edit your markup files may be even less pumped about you editing their <code>.rb</code> or <code>.java</code> files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And through all of this, we haven&#8217;t solved the matter of needing the involvement of a professional writer focused on end users' interests.
Someone will always need to make up for those devs who don&#8217;t love doing docs, as well as provide consistency through editing the work of those who take docs seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Docs generators are cool, but they pertain to developer documentation.
DocOps projects can likely take advantage of many of these tools, especially where structured data can be kept outside scripting files that express actual functionality.
This way, content/data in such files can be pulled into your docs environment for hands-on management, judiciously placed and output in different formats as needed.</p>
</div>
<div id="rest" class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">REST APIs</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I love REST APIs.
A very talented engineer I worked with once assigned me Roy Thomas Fielding&#8217;s epic dissertation on <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm"><em>Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</em></a>.
I cannot claim to have read every word, but I found in it a new level of appreciation for REST interfaces <em>and</em> for technical writing.
I also found a metaphor in the REST API; the elegance of API abstraction correlates to problem solving in DocOps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A REST API is a set of URLs that can be connected to remotely via HTTP/S protocol, either by another server or a client such as a mobile app or Javascript in your laptop browser.
Every interaction between a client and a REST API is a request (precisely like every web page call or form posting by a browser&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a distinct, “stateless” interaction).
The server running a REST API is prepared to respond to the specifics of each interaction with a client:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the URL (“endpoint”) the client is requesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the request&#8217;s “verb” (<code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>any parameters contained in the request</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A REST API request can be a terrifically powerful and highly complex command.
Some REST APIs exchange extraordinary amounts of structured data between machines on an ongoing basis without human intervention.
Others are closer to serving as the middleware of a consumer application&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the way a server-side application interfaces with multiple, disparate clients such as browsers or mobile apps.
Suddenly, this sounds like a problem documentation managers are familiar with: lots of requests from various corners, with the need for universalized handling.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Facebook&#8217;s REST API is an obvious example.
Every interface Facebook provides has to work with the same, big server-side product.
The ideal way to handle this is to provide a universal interface to which all clients must conform.
A REST API is client agnostic; it accepts properly addressed and formatted requests from clients, including authentication data for security, without caring whether the client was Javascript in a web browser or a server on Wall Street.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_output_to_product">Output to Product</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trend in software product interfaces is toward structuring any strings and other data associated with UIs in JSON format.
Everything from labels to inline instructions is passed to the UI as semi-structured text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet very few CCMSes or general documentation processors generate JSON, whether that data starts as HTML, XML, or lightweight markup languages.
There are converters that produce JSON, but DITA CCMSes, reStructuredText, Markdown, and AsciiDoc are not tooled to spit out their own content in a format UIs need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This limitation means that in order to obey the <em>write-once</em> rule, content intended for the UI may need to start and stay in the engineers' domain, closer to where it will be output.
This is very likely fine for most interfaces.
The front-end team doesn&#8217;t need you tinkering directly with the strings used in their UI.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in cases where dynamic data is used in the UI <em>and</em> in your docs, the DRY directive suggests two options:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Your docs build need to pull (query) those strings from the developers' arena, however and wherever they&#8217;re stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need a tool that allows proper maintenance of such content on neutral ground&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;somewhere they can change significant details and you can correct grammatical errors and typos, all while the content remains equally reusable by both the UI compiler and the docs compiler.</p>

<p>Of course, it isn&#8217;t just the product codebase with which I want to integrate.

Whenever Atom gets a little more aware&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;such as when it learned to display locally relative includes in the AsciiDoc Preview pane&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;I feel that much closer to having a better window into my final product.</p>

<p>There are lots of complicating factors that make it non-trivial to show you perfectly how your docs will look by generating a reasonable proximity in realtime.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not asking for pure WYSIWYG power with the ability to write <em>inside</em> my data.
Our point in writing in LML is not that we wish to stare the code in the eye.
Rather, we appreciate the irreducible complexity of the content models we&#8217;re trying to convey.
We don&#8217;t wish to hide semantic elements, such as indicators that a dynamically generated object will appear in the place of this object.
And in most cases, we may not even wish to see our copy mixed in with the dynamic data that will eventually populate our variables and other placeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we do need is the ability to quickly preview our content and design with the data it documents, preferably without having to rebuild every time and check it in another application altogether (such as a browser).</p>

<p>This is one of the controversial defining factors of docs-as-code; you don&#8217;t <em>have to</em> use a lightweight markup language to keep your docs in source and think programmatically.
But as long as the language isn&#8217;t too light to include semantic markup (such as most forms of Markdown and most Wiki MLs), it&#8217;s hard to justify the added burden and expense of tag-based languages (HTML, DITA, Docbook, etc.).</p>

<p>I actually had to add the AsciiDoc tags manually to the previous example because Asciidoctor suppresses all such tags, even inside a literal block.
This is probably a feature, not a bug, as there are use cases when I would want to hide nested AsciiDoc comments when calling their parent code.</p>

<p>I think this field needs more adoption and propagation, for the benefit of us all, so I want to make this book as acceptable as possible.
If a technical publsiher&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or any publisher&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;is interested in putting out an edition, I would gladly consider any arrangement that allows me to maintain a fully open-source copy in my own repo.
Whatever gets these ideas into more minds who can take it to new places, and hopefully bring it back around to this book.</p>

<p>Here are the technical steps to contributing.
If you don&#8217;t know how to use Git or AsciiDoc yet, you may wish to <strong>read the book before trying to contribute</strong>.
In fact, that&#8217;s a good general recommendation, so you don&#8217;t duplicate something that&#8217;s already included, and so you can enhance existing content&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even by contradicting it sensibly.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the appropriate AsciiDoc file, or create and properly include a new one.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">1-sentence per line</dt>
<dd>
<p>To make a space after a sentence-terminating punctuation, use the return key instead of the spacebar.
This gives you at-a-glance insight into sentence strength and paragraph structure, as well as making for easier diff reviewing.</p>

<p>This one is also covered in “<a href="http://codewriting.org/blog/ventilated-prose-hanging-indentation">Ventilated Prose and Hanging Indentation</a>”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">insert classes liberally</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use the <code>[.classname]</code> delimiter tag markup for assigning a CSS class to significant blocks in AsciiDoc.
Use this feature liberally but consistently, marking each block of that type and <em>specific kind of application or in a given series</em> consistently.
For example, this feature is used to mark all of my sidebars (**** wrapped) that reference a running theme, so that I can specifically style just the blocks in that series later on.</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Scenario-classed sideblocks</div>

****
This is some text about the ongoing scenario example about a startup narrated throughout this book (or however I decide to use this).
****</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This block will for instance output with the <code>class="sidebarblock scenario"</code> attribute in its HTML5 tag, which can be selected and styled (or even acted on with JavaScript) using <code>DIV.sidebarblock.scenario.scenario-a</code> (<code>&lt;div class="sidebarblock scenario scenario-a"&gt;</code>).
This is forward-thinking semantic markup; I&#8217;m not even sure how I intend to use it yet.</p>
</div>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">4-char block delimiters</dt>
<dd>
<p>As in the <a href="http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#delimited-blocks">Asciidoc guide</a>, do not be tempted to mess around with block delimiter markup.
Always use the 4-character minimum (for example, <code>|===</code> or <code>----</code>), not anything longer.
The sole exception to this is the <code>--</code> open (generic) block delimiter and the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> triple-LT for page breaks.</p>
